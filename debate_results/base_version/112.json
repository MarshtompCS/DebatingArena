It is merely a superficial comment that does not contribute to the discussion in any meaningful way. Secondly, the statement is not related to the current topic of conversation, which is about football and competitive gaming. Bringing up Halo 3, a game that is not relevant to the discussion, is distracting and detracts from the engagingness of the conversation.\n\nFurthermore, the statement is not particularly witty or clever. It is a predictable response that does not require much thought or creativity. The use of the word \"football\" twice in the same sentence also makes the statement sound repetitive and unpolished.\n\nIn conclusion, while the response may add a moment of levity to the conversation, it is not an engaging response. It does not contribute anything new or insightful to the discussion and is not related to the topic at hand.",
