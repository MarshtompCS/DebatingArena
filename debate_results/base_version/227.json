It not only highlights the urgency of saving our planet but also draws attention to the growing trend of bright minds flocking to modern tech companies like Google. \n\nFurthermore, the fact presented about new Google employees being called 'nooglers' and given a propeller beanie cap on their first Friday is an intriguing piece of information that adds a quirky touch to the conversation. This response has the potential to spark interest and further discussion among the participants and the audience.\n\nOn the other hand, the negative side may argue that the response is completely irrelevant to the conversation topic. However, I would like to counter that argument by stating that the engaging level of a response is not solely based on relevance to the conversation. It also depends on its ability to capture the attention of the audience and stimulate their curiosity.\n\nIn conclusion, the affirmative side strongly believes that the presented response is engaging and has the potential to enhance the overall quality of the conversation. Thank you.",

It is a weak and unsupported argument that distracts from the main topic and fails to provide any meaningful insights.\n\nIn addition, the affirmative side's argument that the engagingness of a response is not solely based on relevance to the conversation is flawed.
