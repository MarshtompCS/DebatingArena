The conversation is about the potential future of the NFL and its ability to attract new fans, and this statement does not contribute to that discussion. It is a tangent that diverts from the main point of the debate, which can lead to disengagement from the audience.\n\nFinally, while being concise is essential, it should not come at the cost of substance.
