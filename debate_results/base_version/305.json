The fact that C.S. Lewis and Tolkien held \"you laugh you lose\" competitions when reading terrible poetry is not only educational but also entertaining. It captures the attention of the listener and encourages them to participate in the conversation. \n\nFurthermore, the response is relevant to the previous discussion about reading and the different ways in which people perceive and enjoy it. It adds a new layer to the discourse and creates a connection between the speakers. \n\nThe con side may argue that the response is not natural or coherent with the conversation, but I disagree. The previous speakers have already established a pattern of sharing interesting facts and commenting on them. The response fits perfectly into this pattern and contributes to the flow of the conversation. \n\nIn conclusion, the response is engaging because it provides new and interesting information, adds humor to the conversation, and is relevant to the topic at hand. It is a valuable addition to the discourse and should be considered a strong contender for the next turn.",

While it may add a new layer to the discourse, it does not necessarily create a strong connection between the speakers. \n\nIn addition, the response may not be seen as natural or coherent by some. While the previous speakers have established a pattern of sharing interesting facts, the sudden shift to discussing a competition held by two famous authors may seem abrupt and out of place. \n\nOverall, while the response may have some engaging qualities, it may not be universally appealing or relevant to the topic at hand. For these reasons, I do not believe it should be considered a strong contender for the next turn.",
