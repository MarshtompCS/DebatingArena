It takes the conversation to a different level by adding a new perspective to the topic. The response is relevant to the fact mentioned and adds value to the conversation. \n\nThe response is engaging because it is thought-provoking and opens up the conversation for further discussion. It makes the other person curious to know more about the topic and adds a new dimension to the conversation. It is also interesting because it challenges the conventional wisdom that football has always been the most popular sport in the US.\n\nFurthermore, the response is engaging because it is surprising and unexpected. It is not a typical response that one would expect in this conversation. It catches the other person off guard and forces them to think about the topic in a different way. This makes the conversation more interesting and lively.\n\nIn conclusion, the response provided by the affirmative side is highly engaging because it is relevant, thought-provoking, interesting, and surprising. It takes the conversation to a different level and adds value to the discussion. Therefore, we believe that this response should be chosen as the next turn in the conversation.",

Firstly, the response is not a direct answer to the previous statement made by the other person. It diverts the conversation to a completely different topic, which might not be relevant to the current conversation. This could make the other person lose interest in the conversation.\n\nMoreover, while the response may be surprising, it does not necessarily make it engaging. The fact that bowling was more popular than football in the 1960s is not a new or unknown fact. It has been discussed and debated before. Therefore, the response does not add anything new or insightful to the conversation, which makes it less engaging.\n\nFurthermore, the tone of the response is quite flat and does not show any enthusiasm or passion. It is just a plain statement of a fact, which does not make it engaging. An engaging response should have energy, enthusiasm, and show a genuine interest in the topic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the response provided by the affirmative side may be interesting, it is not engaging enough to be chosen as the next turn in the conversation.
