Firstly, it demonstrates active listening and engagement in the conversation by acknowledging the previous speaker's comment about negotiating with robot helmets on. Secondly, it adds to the conversation by agreeing with the idea of negotiating incognito and adds a practical element by suggesting it as a way to keep track of things. This response also opens up the possibility for further discussion on negotiating tactics and methods, making it a highly engaging contribution to the conversation.

Firstly, it does not directly relate to the topic of negotiating with robot helmets on, which was the previous speaker's comment.

On the other hand, the negative argued that the response does not directly relate to the topic at hand, is generic, and does not offer any unique or thought-provoking ideas.\n\nBased on these arguments, the affirmative wins the debate as they provided more compelling reasons for why the potential response is engaging. They demonstrated how the response adds value and encourages further discussion, while the negative only focused on its limitations.",
