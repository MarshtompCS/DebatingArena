Firstly, this response is relevant to the previous question, which was about liking football. Therefore, it keeps the conversation flowing smoothly. Secondly, by asking a question, the speaker is showing a genuine interest in the other person's opinion, which is a great way to build rapport and create a connection. This response is not only engaging but also helps to build a positive relationship between the two speakers. \n\nFurthermore, this response is open-ended, which means that it allows the other person to express their thoughts freely. It is a great way to encourage the other person to speak more and to share their opinions. This response is an excellent way to keep the conversation going and prevent it from becoming dull or boring. \n\nIn conclusion, the response, \"I do like football, how about you?\" is an engaging and effective way to keep the conversation flowing smoothly, build rapport, and encourage the other person to express their thoughts freely. Therefore, I urge you to vote in favor of this response.",

The response, \"I do like football, how about you?\" may seem engaging, but it has several disadvantages that should be considered. \n\nFirstly, this response is quite predictable and does not provide any new information or insights. It is a common response that does not add any value to the conversation. This can make the conversation seem dull and uninteresting. \n\nSecondly, while asking a question can be a great way to build rapport, the question itself is not very thought-provoking. It is a closed-ended question that does not encourage the other person to share more about their thoughts or feelings. Therefore, it is not an effective way to create a deeper connection between two speakers. \n\nIn conclusion, the response, \"I do like football, how about you?\" may seem engaging at first glance, but it has several disadvantages that should not be ignored. It is predictable, uninteresting, and does not encourage deeper conversation or connection. Therefore, I urge you to vote against this response.",

In fact, predictability can be comforting and reassuring, especially when it comes to social interactions. The response provides a common ground for the two speakers to connect on, which is essential in building a positive relationship.\n\nMoreover, it is not fair to say that the response is uninteresting. The response shows that the speaker is open to discussing the topic and is interested in the other person's opinion. It is an excellent way to keep the conversation going and prevent it from becoming stagnant.\n\nLastly, while it is true that the response is a closed-ended question, it still encourages the other person to share their thoughts and feelings about football. It is an invitation for the other person to express their opinions, which can lead to more meaningful and engaging conversation.\n\nIn conclusion, the response, \"I do like football, how about you?\" is engaging and effective in building a positive relationship, keeping the conversation going, and encouraging the other person to share their thoughts and feelings. Therefore, I urge you to reconsider and vote in favor of this response.",

The negative countered that the response is predictable, lacks originality, and is not an effective way to encourage deeper conversation or connection.\n\nAfter considering both sides, I have to declare the negative as the winner of the debate. The negative presented stronger arguments by highlighting the limitations of the response, such as predictability and lack of originality. They argued that the response does not provide an invitation for the other person to express their opinions freely and does not encourage deeper conversation or connection. Therefore, the negative's argument about the response being unengaging was more convincing, and they win the debate.",
