First of all, it acknowledges the difficulty of the situation and shows empathy towards the issue at hand. This builds a rapport with the speaker, which is essential for any engaging conversation. Additionally, the response diverts the conversation to a related topic, the consumer ratings, which could be of interest to the speaker. This shows active listening and the ability to steer the conversation towards a mutually engaging topic. In conclusion, while the response may seem unrelated, it is actually quite engaging due to its empathetic tone and the ability to steer the conversation towards a related topic.",

The negative argues that the response is not engaging because it completely ignores the topic at hand and diverts the conversation to an unrelated topic.\n\n[Decision]:\nBased on the arguments presented, the negative wins the debate. While empathy and the ability to steer the conversation towards a related topic are important, they are not enough to make the response engaging if it completely ignores the topic at hand. The negative effectively argues that the response fails to engage the speaker by ignoring the current topic and diverting the conversation to an unrelated topic.",
