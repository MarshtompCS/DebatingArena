        "content": ": While we do agree that the response provided by the affirmative side is interesting and unique, we cannot say that it is highly engaging. The response does not add any value to the conversation, nor does it keep the audience hooked. The fact about U2 playing country music in wigs and costumes may be intriguing, but it is not relevant to the current topic of discussion.\n\nFurthermore, the response lacks coherence and naturalness. It feels forced and out of place, as if it was thrown in just to impress the audience. It does not flow smoothly with the previous conversation, and it does not provide any new insights or ideas.\n\nLastly, the response is not compelling enough to spark a conversation on its own. It may elicit a brief reaction from the listener, but it does not offer any substantial material for the discussion to continue. It is merely a random fact that may or may not interest the audience, and it does not contribute to the overall engagingness of the conversation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the response may be interesting, it lacks relevance, coherence, and naturalness. It does not add any value to the conversation, and it is not compelling enough to keep the audience engaged. Therefore, we argue that it is not a highly engaging response.",
