Firstly, it shows interest in the previous topic of conversation, which is key to maintaining a smooth flow of dialogue. Additionally, the response adds to the conversation by asking a follow-up question about the crab feast and confirms an assumption about the event being discussed. This not only shows active listening, but also encourages the other person to continue the conversation. The mention of Flasher performing at Fort Reno concert also adds another layer of interest and can lead to further discussion about music and upcoming events. In conclusion, this response is engaging because it interacts with the conversation, asks a question, confirms an assumption, and adds a new detail.",
