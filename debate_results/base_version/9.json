While it is true that the response is unexpected and has a conversational tone, it is not engaging in the context of the conversation at hand.

        "topic_chat_fact": "the raiders sacked goff only once , on a play during which bruce irvin forced a fumble . other than that , the oakland defense could put almost no pressure on goff . the absence of mack , the former nfl defensive player of the year , was glaring . in the first half sunday night , mack had a sack , a forced fumble , a fumble recovery , an interception and a touchdown on defense . he and the bears could not sustain that , and they succumbed to the second - half exploits of packers quarterback aaron rodgers . but mack reinforced what a game - changing , difference - making player he is . he left little doubt that he is worth the six - year , $ 141 million contract given to him by the bears , making him the league 's highest - paid defensive player . [ the nfl teams that have serious reasons to worry , versus the ones that do n't ] mack , while still with the raiders , had been holding out , seeking such a deal . the raiders did n't want to give it to him . they have a $ 125 million quarterback in carr . they have a $ 100 million coach in gruden . they drew the line at handing out another mammoth deal , not wanting to further strain their budget or push the boundaries of the salary cap . they regarded the king 's ransom of draft picks put forth by the bears , including a pair of first - rounders , as an offer they could n't refuse . in truth , they could have refused it .\n",
