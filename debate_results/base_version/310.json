This response creates a sense of curiosity and interest in the topic, which is essential for an engaging conversation. By asking a question, the speaker also shows that they are actively listening and interested in what the other person has to say, which can lead to a deeper and more meaningful conversation. \n\nThe negative side may argue that the response is not engaging because it's a closed-ended question that doesn't add any value to the conversation. However, this opinion is flawed because the response is not just a simple question, but rather a thought-provoking inquiry that encourages the other person to share their own thoughts and experiences. By asking if the other person knew about the Facebook-Twitter collaboration, the speaker also demonstrates that they are open to learning and expanding their knowledge, which can make the conversation more dynamic and engaging. \n\nIn conclusion, the potential response \"No, I didn't know that.
