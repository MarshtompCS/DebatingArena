It shows that the speaker is interested in the topic at hand and is willing to continue the conversation. Furthermore, it is an open-ended question that prompts the other person to share their thoughts on the subject. This not only keeps the conversation going but also allows for a deeper connection between the speakers. \n\nThe con side may argue that the response is not relevant to the conversation at hand, but I would like to point out that in a casual conversation, the topic can often shift and take unexpected turns. This response acknowledges the fact that the conversation has taken a new direction and is a great way to keep it going. \n\nIn conclusion, this response is a prime example of engaging conversation. It shows interest, prompts further discussion, and allows for a deeper connection between the speakers. Therefore, I urge the moderator to allow the conversation to continue.",
