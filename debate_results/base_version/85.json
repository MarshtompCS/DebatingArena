Firstly, the response acknowledges the question asked and adds a new perspective to the conversation. By stating that the speaker did not read about the 6 foot 10 inch tall tennis player, but knows that tennis is the most valuable sport in the world, the response adds relevant information to the conversation, which can prompt further discussion.\n\nMoreover, the response has the potential to spark curiosity and interest in the listener. By mentioning that tennis is the most valuable sport in the world, the listener may want to know more about the sport and its financial significance. This can lead to a deeper and more engaging conversation.\n\nLastly, the response is opinionated, which can provoke a lively and engaging debate. By stating that tennis is the most valuable sport in the world, the speaker is expressing their opinion, which can be challenged or agreed upon by the listener. This can create a back-and-forth exchange, which can make the conversation more dynamic and interesting.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential response in question is highly engaging as it adds relevant information, sparks curiosity, and is opinionated. It has the potential to create a lively and engaging conversation, which is the ultimate goal of any conversation.",

The listener may be curious to learn more about why the speaker thinks tennis is the most valuable sport, which can lead to a more engaging and informative conversation.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential response is still highly engaging as it indirectly addresses the question, is opinionated, and introduces a new topic of discussion.
