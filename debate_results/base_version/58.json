        "content": "The potential response, \"what's their first thing about the celebrities?\" is highly engaging for several reasons. Firstly, it immediately draws the listener's attention towards the topic of celebrities, which is a universally popular and intriguing subject. This is likely to pique the interest of the listener, and encourage them to engage in the conversation further.\n\nSecondly, the response is open-ended and leaves room for further discussion. By asking \"what's their first thing about the celebrities?\" the speaker is essentially inviting the other person to share their own opinion or insight on the subject. This creates a sense of collaboration and encourages a back-and-forth exchange, which is key to keeping a conversation engaging.\n\nFinally, the response is unexpected and adds an element of surprise to the conversation. The fact that Pixar has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities is not directly related to the previous topic of YouTube celebrities, and so the listener is likely to be taken aback by this sudden change in direction. This element of surprise can help to keep the conversation fresh and interesting, and prevent it from becoming stale or predictable.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential response \"what's their first thing about the celebrities?\" is highly engaging due to its ability to draw the listener's attention, leave room for further discussion, and add an element of surprise to the conversation.",

While it is true that the response is open-ended and unexpected, it is not necessarily engaging in the context of the conversation. The topic of the conversation has been focused on YouTube celebrities and the impact of YouTube on the star system. The fact about Pixar's secret room and celebrities visiting it is not directly related to the topic at hand, and so the response may come across as a non-sequitur or a distraction from the main point.\n\nFurthermore, the response does not add any new insight or perspective to the conversation. It is simply a question that invites the other person to share their opinion, without offering any of the speaker's own thoughts or ideas. This can create a sense of disengagement, as the listener may feel that the speaker is not fully invested in the conversation or does not have anything meaningful to contribute.\n\nOverall, while the potential response may be unexpected and open-ended, it does not effectively contribute to the engagingness of the conversation. In order to keep the conversation engaging, the speakers should focus on building upon the existing topic and adding new insights and perspectives that are relevant and thought-provoking.",
