Firstly, the response lacks relevance to the current topic of conversation, which is whether the speaker still watches things on traditional TV. The response does not address this topic and instead shifts the focus to a different subject.\n\nMoreover, the response is too general and provides no new information or insights into the speaker's thoughts or opinions. It is a cliche statement that many people could make, and therefore, it does not add any value to the conversation. It also does not encourage the other person to respond, as it does not ask any further questions or provide any new points to discuss.\n\nFinally, the response may not be relatable to everyone, as not everyone may have grown up watching the Simpsons or may not enjoy the show. The speaker's enthusiasm may also come across as forced or insincere, which can negatively impact the engaging level of the conversation.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential response \"I love the Simpsons!\" is not an engaging response because of its lack of relevance, generality, and potential to be unrelatable or insincere.
