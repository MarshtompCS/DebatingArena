        "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, the potential response in question is undeniably engaging. The affirmative side sees this response as advantageous because it takes the conversation to a whole new level. The response not only acknowledges the previous topic, but it also introduces a fascinating and thought-provoking fact, which is sure to spark interest in the audience. Moreover, the response adds an element of humor and imagination by suggesting that we could ask aliens for help with our helium problem. This creates a playful and light-hearted tone that keeps the conversation lively and engaging. \n\nNow, the con side may argue that the response is not relevant to the previous discussion about Earth's rotation and that it is too far-fetched. However, we must remember that the purpose of this competition is to judge the engaging level of the response, not its coherence or relevance. In fact, this response's off-topic nature is what makes it so engaging, as it surprises the audience and encourages them to think outside the box. \n\nIn conclusion, the affirmative side firmly believes that the potential response is highly engaging and has several advantages. It introduces a fascinating fact, adds humor and imagination to the conversation, and takes the discussion in a new direction. We urge the moderator to let the conversation continue and see where it takes us.",

        "content": ": Ladies and gentlemen, while the affirmative side makes some valid points about the potential response, we must not forget that the purpose of the debate is to judge the engaging level of the response, and in our opinion, this response falls short in that regard. \n\nFirstly, the response completely veers off-topic and does not contribute to the previous discussion about Earth's rotation. This abrupt change in topic could confuse and disengage the audience, as they may find it challenging to follow the conversation's flow. \n\nSecondly, the response's attempt at humor and imagination by suggesting we ask aliens for help with our helium problem is a bit too far-fetched and unrealistic. This may make the audience feel disconnected and disengaged, as they may find it difficult to relate to such an outlandish idea. \n\nFinally, while we agree that the response introduces a fascinating fact, it fails to connect that fact with the previous discussion or the overall theme of the conversation. This lack of relevance could disengage the audience and cause them to lose interest in the conversation. \n\nIn conclusion, while the potential response may have some advantages, we believe that its lack of relevance, abrupt change in topic, and unrealistic suggestion make it less engaging than the affirmative side suggests. We urge the moderator to consider these points and decide whether this response is truly engaging enough to continue the conversation.",
