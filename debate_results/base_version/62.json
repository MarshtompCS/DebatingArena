        "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, the response presented by our affirmative team is undeniably engaging. It shows a personal touch by sharing the fact that the speaker has not swum competitively but still enjoys the sport. This is a great way to connect with the person they are conversing with, as it shows a willingness to share personal information and engage in a meaningful conversation. \n\nFurthermore, the response is unique as it adds a new perspective to the conversation. While the previous speaker shared their interest in watching sports, the affirmative team's response adds a layer of personal experience that makes the conversation more interesting and engaging. \n\nIn addition, the response is concise and to the point, which is essential in keeping the conversation flowing and intriguing. It does not drag on or become convoluted, which can quickly lose the attention of the other person. \n\nTherefore, I strongly believe that the affirmative team's response is highly engaging and adds value to the conversation.",

The fact that the speaker has not swum competitively is not relevant to the conversation about liking sports. It is simply a random fact that does not contribute to the discussion.\n\nMoreover, the response lacks enthusiasm and energy, which can make the conversation dull and uninteresting. The speaker mentions that they \"do like it though,\" but there is no excitement or passion behind the statement. This can quickly lose the attention of the other person and make them lose interest in the conversation.\n\nAdditionally, the response does not encourage further discussion or questions. It does not provide any openings for the other person to continue the conversation, which can lead to an awkward silence and end the conversation prematurely.\n\nTherefore, I believe that the negative team's argument stands. The response is not engaging, and it does not add any value to the conversation.",

The fact that the speaker mentions that they like swimming despite not having competed shows a genuine interest in the sport. This can spark further discussion, such as why they enjoy swimming or what their favorite swimming strokes are.\n\nFinally, the response does not need to provide explicit openings for further conversation. The fact shared by the speaker can naturally lead to follow-up questions, such as if they have ever considered competing in swimming or what their favorite sports are.\n\nIn conclusion, the affirmative team's response is engaging as it shows a personal touch, adds a unique perspective, and is concise.
