It not only acknowledges the fact that the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland 222-0, but also expresses empathy towards the losing team. This response is engaging because it shows that the speaker is not only knowledgeable about the sport but also capable of empathizing with others, which can lead to a more meaningful and engaging conversation.\n\nFurthermore, this response is engaging because it invites further discussion. The speaker's acknowledgement of the historical fact and empathy towards the losing team creates an opportunity to delve deeper into the topic of football and sportsmanship. This can lead to a more engaging conversation that explores the different aspects of sports and how they impact society.\n\nIn contrast, the negative may argue that the response lacks substance and does not contribute to the conversation. However, I would argue that the engagingness of a response is not solely based on its content but also on how it makes the listener feel. In this case, the response evokes empathy and creates a more meaningful conversation, which in turn makes it highly engaging.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential response \"that would be really hard. ga tech sure did dominate that game.\" is highly engaging because it shows knowledge of the sport, empathy towards others, and creates an opportunity for further discussion.",

While it may acknowledge the fact that the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland 222-0, it adds no significant value to the conversation. \n\nThe response is too short and lacks substance, making it difficult to continue the conversation. It does not provide any new information or insights that could encourage further dialogue. Instead, it merely repeats what has already been said and offers a general statement that does not contribute to the discussion.\n\nMoreover, the response does not showcase any unique or personal opinions of the speaker.
