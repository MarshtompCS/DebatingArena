Firstly, by acknowledging that they haven't seen the show, the speaker is presenting themselves as open-minded and willing to learn. This can lead to a more interesting and dynamic conversation as the other person may feel more comfortable sharing their own opinions and experiences.\n\nAdditionally, the phrase \"but have heard of it\" suggests that the speaker is aware of the cultural significance of Game of Thrones, even if they haven't watched it themselves. This can be a great starting point for a conversation about popular culture, and can lead to discussions about other shows or movies that may interest both parties.\n\nFurthermore, the brevity of the response leaves room for the other person to contribute and continue the conversation. This can result in a more collaborative and engaging dialogue, rather than a one-sided discussion dominated by either party.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential response \"I do, I haven't seen it but have heard of it\" is engaging because it is open-minded, culturally aware, and leaves room for further discussion.",

Firstly, the response is very vague and does not provide any substantial information that can lead to a more interesting conversation. In fact, the response is quite unremarkable and does not convey any particular opinions or insights.\n\nFurthermore, the response does not reflect any real interest in the topic at hand. Merely stating that one has heard of a show does not demonstrate a willingness to engage with the conversation or to learn more about it. This can lead to a lackluster and unengaging dialogue, which can quickly become boring and unproductive.\n\nLastly, the response is quite passive and does not provide any real contribution to the conversation. By simply acknowledging that one has heard of the show, the speaker is not actively engaging with the topic or trying to add anything new or interesting to the conversation. This can lead to a one-sided dialogue where the other person is left to carry the conversation.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not believe that the potential response \"I do, I haven't seen it but have heard of it\" is engaging. It is vague, unremarkable, passive, and does not reflect any real interest in the topic at hand.",

On the other hand, the negative argued that the response is vague, unremarkable, passive, and does not reflect any real interest in the topic at hand.\n\nAfter considering both opinions, I believe that the negative has won the debate. While the affirmative presented some good points, the negative's argument that the response is too vague and passive outweighs the affirmative's points. Therefore, I believe that the potential response \"I do, I haven't seen it but have heard of it\" is not engaging.",
