The response is not only engaging but also shows a keen interest in the topic at hand, demonstrating that the speaker is actively listening and processing the information shared by the other participant. Furthermore, it adds an element of surprise and curiosity, making the conversation more intriguing and exciting. The con side's argument against the response's engagingness level is unfounded, as they have not provided any valid reasons to support their claim.

It is merely a question that does not add any significant value to the conversation. The question is not relevant to the fact presented, and it does not contribute to the discussion on swimming or the history of swimming strokes. Instead, it diverts the conversation's focus, leading to a potential loss of interest from the other participant. Furthermore, the question asked is rhetorical, making it less engaging as it does not require a response from the other participant. Therefore, I argue that the response is not engaging and does not add value to the conversation.",
