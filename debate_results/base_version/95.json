        "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, the response \"Yeah, Bill Murray called it 'the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy'\" is undeniably engaging. First and foremost, it's a direct and concise answer to the previous question. It doesn't beat around the bush, but instead addresses the question head-on. \n\nSecondly, the response includes a quote from a well-known celebrity, Bill Murray, which immediately grabs the attention of the listener. It's not just any quote, but a high praise for the movie in question - \"the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy\". This quote alone is enough to pique the listener's interest and make them want to know more about the movie.\n\nLastly, the response also provides an opportunity for further discussion. The moderator or the negative side can follow up with questions about the movie, or they can even share their own opinions about it. This opens up the conversation and keeps it flowing in an engaging manner.\n\nIn conclusion, the response is engaging because it's direct, includes a celebrity quote, and provides an opportunity for further discussion. I urge the negative side to reconsider their stance and acknowledge the engaging level of this response.",

        "content": ": Thank you for your points, but I'm afraid I cannot agree with your opinion. While the quote from Bill Murray may catch the listener's attention, the response itself is lacking in substance. Simply stating a celebrity's opinion does not necessarily make a response engaging. \n\nFurthermore, the response does not provide any personal insight or opinion about the movie itself. It's merely regurgitating someone else's opinion, which can come off as insincere or unoriginal. \n\nLastly, the response does not add any new information to the conversation. The fact that Bill Murray enjoyed the movie has already been mentioned, so the response does not contribute anything new or thought-provoking to the discussion.\n\nIn conclusion, while the quote from Bill Murray may be attention-grabbing, the lack of personal insight and new information makes the response ultimately unengaging.",
