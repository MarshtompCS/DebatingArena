Firstly, it provides an interesting and little-known fact about the human body, piquing the listener's curiosity. Secondly, it highlights the fascinating process of evolution, which is a topic that many people find intriguing. Finally, it adds to the overall knowledge of the conversation, making it a more engaging and informative exchange. I urge the moderator to let the conversation continue so that we can learn even more fascinating facts.",

Additionally, the response is straightforward and lacks any element of surprise or humor, both of which are crucial in making a conversation engaging.
