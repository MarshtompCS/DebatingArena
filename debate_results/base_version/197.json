It brings up a thought-provoking topic that is relevant to the conversation at hand. By asking if we will ever see any female players in the NFL, it encourages further discussion and debate. \n\nMoreover, the response is unique and unexpected. It adds a new dimension to the conversation and showcases the speaker's knowledge about the NFL. It also challenges traditional gender norms, which is a topic that is increasingly important in today's society. \n\nThe con side may argue that this topic is irrelevant to the conversation at hand, but I would like to rebut that by stating that the conversation had already moved on to discussing players and the NFL. Therefore, the potential response is not out of place, but rather an extension of the current topic. \n\nIn conclusion, the potential response is engaging because it brings up a thought-provoking topic, is unique and unexpected, and challenges traditional gender norms. I urge the moderator to allow for further discussion on this topic.",

The potential response risks derailing the conversation and taking it in a direction that may not be of interest to everyone involved. \n\nLastly, the potential response does not add any new information or insights to the conversation. It is a simple question that does not contribute to the discussion in any meaningful way. \n\nIn conclusion, the potential response is not highly engaging because it is not directly related to the current topic, risks derailing the conversation, and does not add any new information or insights.
