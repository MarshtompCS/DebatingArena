While the fact about Reggie Miller and his sister is interesting, it is not relevant to the current topic of conversation about the Milwaukee Bucks and their players. The response completely changes the direction of the conversation, which can be confusing and off-putting to the person you are speaking with.\n\nFurthermore, the response lacks coherence and naturalness. It seems like the affirmative participant simply inserted the fact about Reggie Miller and his sister into the conversation without any real connection to the previous topics discussed. This can come across as forced and insincere, which can be a turn-off for the person you are speaking to.\n\nOverall, the response provided by the affirmative participant is not engaging due to its lack of relevance, coherence, and naturalness.
