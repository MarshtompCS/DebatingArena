This fact is likely to catch the listener's attention and generate curiosity about what could have possibly gone wrong at the concert. The response also adds to the engagingness by speculating about the possible reasons for the lawsuit, such as mechanical problems or a band member's poor performance. Additionally, the response provides an interesting anecdote about a different concert where the performer was drunk on stage and had to refund the audience's money. This further adds to the engagingness by providing an unexpected and intriguing twist to the conversation. Overall, this potential response is highly engaging and is likely to keep the listener interested and invested in the conversation.",

( jazz or otherwise ? ) \n that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though . \n it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music ! \n i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii \n wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ... \n it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters \n well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ? \n now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit \n\n",
