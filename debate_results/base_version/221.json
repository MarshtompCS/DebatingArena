The negative participant, on the other hand, argued that the response may not be engaging for all listeners, does not offer new insights or perspectives, and does not invite further discussion.\n\nAfter considering both arguments, the winner of the debate is the affirmative participant. They provided stronger evidence for why the response is engaging, such as the potential to pique the listener's interest and the fact that it can still serve a purpose without posing a question. The negative participant's arguments were not strong enough to counter these points. Therefore, the affirmative participant wins the debate.",
