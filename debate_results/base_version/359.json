The fact about the Indonesian president's pop career has no connection to the topic of discussing the election process and the role of the vice president. Therefore, the listener may feel confused and disinterested in continuing the conversation.\n\nFurthermore, the response may come across as insensitive and unprofessional. Bringing up the idea of a pop album in the context of discussing serious political matters, such as the election process and the role of the vice president, may be seen as trivializing the topic. This could lead to the listener losing respect for the speaker and disengaging from the conversation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the response may be entertaining, it is not entirely relevant to the conversation and may come across as insensitive and unprofessional.
