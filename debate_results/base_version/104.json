Let me tell you why.\n\nFirstly, it brings up a controversial topic that is bound to spark discussion. The fact that four concert-goers filed a lawsuit against Creed is a surprising and thought-provoking piece of information that will definitely grab the attention of anyone listening.\n\nSecondly, the response shows a level of empathy towards the band, while also acknowledging the humor in the situation. This creates a balance between different emotions that will keep the conversation interesting and engaging.\n\nFinally, the use of the phrase \"I don't know how I feel about\" invites others to join in the conversation and express their own opinions. This not only keeps the conversation going, but it also shows a willingness to listen to other perspectives and engage in a healthy debate.\n\nIn conclusion, the response \"I know, I don't know how I feel about Creed being so bad, they were sued by 4 people!\" is engaging because it brings up a controversial topic, balances different emotions, and invites others to join in the conversation.",

The response \"I know, I don't know how I feel about Creed being so bad, they were sued by 4 people!\" is not as engaging as they make it out to be.\n\nFirstly, simply mentioning that four people filed a lawsuit against Creed is not enough to spark a meaningful discussion. It lacks depth and substance, and does not offer any new insights or perspectives on the matter.\n\nSecondly, while the response does show empathy towards the band, it also shows a lack of conviction and strong opinion. This can lead to a lackluster conversation with no clear direction or purpose.\n\nFinally, the use of the phrase \"I don't know how I feel about\" can come across as indecisive and unconfident, which can detract from the overall engagingness of the response.\n\nIn conclusion, the response \"I know, I don't know how I feel about Creed being so bad, they were sued by 4 people!\" is not as engaging as the affirmative claims it to be.

While the response \"I know, I don't know how I feel about Creed being so bad, they were sued by 4 people!\" may not offer a deep analysis of the situation, it does provide an interesting and controversial topic for discussion. The fact that a band as popular as Creed was sued by four concert-goers is something that people may not be aware of, and it can spark a conversation about the responsibility of musicians to their fans.\n\nFurthermore, the response does not lack conviction or strong opinion. In fact, it shows a level of empathy towards the band while also acknowledging the humor in the situation. This balance of emotions can lead to a more engaging conversation that is not one-sided.\n\nLastly, the use of the phrase \"I don't know how I feel about\" does not necessarily mean indecisiveness. It can mean that the responder is open to hearing other opinions and willing to engage in a healthy debate. This can lead to a more engaging conversation where different perspectives are shared and discussed.\n\nIn conclusion, the response \"I know, I don't know how I feel about Creed being so bad, they were sued by 4 people!\" is still engaging as it provides a controversial topic, a balance of emotions, and willingness to hear other opinions.",
