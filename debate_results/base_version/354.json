While my opponent argues that the response \"yeah. did you know the president of Indonesia is a pop star?\" is undeniably engaging, I must disagree. \n\nFirstly, this response is not relevant to the conversation at hand, which is about the knowledge of the speakers regarding presidents and their trivia. The fact that the president of Indonesia is a pop star may be interesting, but it does not contribute to the topic of discussion. This response is therefore not engaging in the context of the conversation.\n\nSecondly, while the response may be surprising, it is not necessarily engaging. The listener may find the fact trivial or unimportant, and as a result, the conversation may not progress further. The response lacks depth and does not offer anything substantial to the conversation.\n\nLastly, my opponent claims that the response has a humorous element to it, which can lighten the mood and make the conversation more enjoyable. However, this is a matter of personal preference, and not everyone may find the response humorous. Humor can also be subjective and may not be enough to sustain an engaging conversation.\n\nIn conclusion, the response \"yeah. did you know the president of Indonesia is a pop star?\" is not engaging in the context of the conversation, lacks depth, and may not be humorous to everyone. Therefore, I urge you to vote for the negative and recognize the limitations of this response.",
