He also was the director and provided the voice for Edna Mode in the movie,\" is highly engaging. \n\nFirstly, this response is highly informative and adds to the conversation by providing additional knowledge about the movie. By mentioning that Brad Bird was both the writer and director of the movie, the response highlights his creative talent and provides insight into the film-making process. Additionally, the fact that he voiced the character of Edna Mode during storyboarding sessions adds an interesting tidbit about the behind-the-scenes work that goes into making an animated movie.\n\nFurthermore, the response is delivered in a concise and confident manner, which helps to capture and maintain the attention of the listener. The use of exclamation marks also adds excitement and enthusiasm to the response, making it more engaging and memorable.\n\nIn contrast, the negative side may argue that the response lacks relevance to the conversation at hand. However, I would counter this argument by pointing out that the conversation is about the Incredibles 2 movie, and the response directly relates to the topic by providing information about the creative team behind the film.\n\nOverall, I believe that the potential response is highly engaging due to its informative content and confident delivery.",

Instead, it simply provides new information without any real connection to the ongoing conversation.
