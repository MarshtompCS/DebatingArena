        "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, the response \"well, in 39 out of 50 states, the highest-paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach\" is undeniably engaging. It is an interesting fact that is likely to catch the attention of most people, particularly those who are sports enthusiasts. \n\nMoreover, this response has the potential to spark a conversation about the role of sports in our society, the high salaries of coaches, and the value we place on athletics. It can also lead to a discussion about the education system and the allocation of resources, which are important topics that are relevant to many people. \n\nIn addition, this response is short and to the point, making it easy to understand and remember. It is also a surprising fact that may challenge people's preconceived notions about the highest-paid state employees, and this can lead to a more meaningful and productive conversation. \n\nTherefore, I urge the moderator to allow this engaging response to be used in the ongoing conversation. Thank you.",

        "content": ": While I agree that the response does contain an interesting fact, I do not believe it is as engaging as my opponent suggests. Firstly, it is a well-known fact that college sports are a big business in America, and many people are already aware of the high salaries of college coaches. Therefore, the response may not be as surprising or thought-provoking as my opponent claims.\n\nMoreover, the response does not contribute much to the ongoing conversation about basketball and its history. It is merely a statement of fact that is unlikely to lead to any meaningful discussion or debate. In fact, it may even derail the conversation and shift the focus away from the topic at hand.\n\nFinally, while the response is short and easy to understand, it lacks any personal connection or emotion that can make a response truly engaging. It is simply a statement of fact without any passion or enthusiasm behind it.\n\nIn conclusion, while the response may be interesting to some, it is not engaging enough to warrant its use in the conversation. We should focus on more relevant and thought-provoking topics that can lead to a more productive discussion. Thank you.",

        "content": "Both the affirmative and negative participants presented compelling arguments regarding the engaging level of the potential response. The affirmative argued that the response is interesting, easy to understand, and has the potential to spark a conversation about important topics such as the role of sports in our society and the allocation of resources. On the other hand, the negative argued that the response is not as engaging as it may seem, lacks personal connection, and may derail the ongoing conversation.\n\nAfter considering both arguments, I believe that the negative participant wins this debate. While the potential response may contain an interesting fact, it is not engaging enough to warrant its use in the conversation. Furthermore, the response may shift the focus away from the topic at hand and fail to contribute to a meaningful discussion.",
