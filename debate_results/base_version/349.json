Firstly, it is a bold statement that immediately captures the attention of the listener. Secondly, the repetition of \"great CEO\" emphasizes the speaker's admiration for Jeff Bezos, which could potentially spark a debate on the qualities of a great CEO. Lastly, the use of the word \"genius\" adds a layer of intrigue and curiosity as to why the speaker believes this to be true.\n\nThe opposing side may argue that the response lacks substance and is not a valid contribution to the conversation. However, I would argue that the engagingness of a response lies in its ability to provoke a reaction from the listener, and this response does just that. It opens up the conversation to a discussion on the qualities of a great CEO and the impact of Jeff Bezos on Amazon.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential response is highly engaging due to its bold statement, repetition, and use of the word \"genius.\" It adds an element of intrigue and opens up the conversation to a potential debate. Therefore, I strongly support the engaging level of this response.",

Firstly, the response lacks any substance or explanation as to why the speaker believes Jeff Bezos is a great CEO or genius. It is simply a statement without any supporting evidence or reasoning. \n\nSecondly, the repetition of \"great CEO\" does not necessarily make the response engaging. In fact, it may come across as repetitive and unoriginal. It does not add any new information or perspectives to the conversation. \n\nLastly, the use of the word \"genius\" without any explanation or context can be seen as hyperbolic and unconvincing. It does not encourage the listener to engage further in the conversation, but rather it may lead to confusion or dismissal of the speaker's opinion.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential response lacks substance, originality, and convincing argumentation. It does not contribute to a meaningful conversation and fails to engage the listener. Therefore, I must argue that the engagingness level of this response is low.",

The potential response lacks coherence and fails to provide any meaningful contribution to the conversation. The repetition of \"great CEO\" and the use of the word \"genius\" without any explanation or context do not encourage further engagement from the listener. Therefore, the negative's argument that the engagingness level of the response is low is more convincing.",
