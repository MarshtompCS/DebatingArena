It can help to spark curiosity among the participants and encourage them to share their thoughts and opinions. Additionally, the use of an exclamation mark adds a sense of excitement and energy to the conversation. \n\nMoreover, the response does not shut down the conversation but rather invites further discussion by expressing a desire to learn more. This can help to keep the conversation flowing and prevent it from becoming dull or stagnant. \n\nIn conclusion, the response \"I would love to see that one! I would love to see it!\" is an engaging and positive response that can help to maintain a lively conversation.
