It not only acknowledges and continues the conversation, but it also adds an interesting fact that could potentially spark further discussion. The mention of a manager's ability to play for their team is a lesser-known fact that could surprise and intrigue the listener, encouraging them to continue the conversation. \n\nMoreover, the affirmative response also shows a genuine interest in the conversation by expressing excitement to revisit Arizona and praising the character of sports professionals who are decent people in real life. This personal touch not only makes the response more relatable but also adds a layer of sincerity that could further engage the listener.\n\nIn conclusion, the affirmative response is engaging because it adds interesting facts and personal experiences to the conversation, making it more relatable and genuine. Its ability to intrigue and encourage further discussion makes it an excellent example of an engaging response. Thank you.",
