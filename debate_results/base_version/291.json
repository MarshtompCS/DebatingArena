Firstly, this response is unexpected and catches the listener off guard, which immediately grabs their attention. It also prompts a follow-up question, \"why she has not banned her music,\" which encourages further discussion and keeps the conversation flowing.\n\nFurthermore, the response shows a sense of humor and wit, making it more memorable and enjoyable for the listener. It also adds a personal touch by expressing curiosity about the artist's actions and decisions, which creates a sense of empathy and connection between the speakers.\n\nIn contrast, the negative side may argue that the response is irrelevant to the previous topic of conversation. However, I believe this response adds a refreshing change of pace to the conversation, preventing it from becoming too heavy or monotonous. It also demonstrates the speaker's ability to think creatively and outside the box, which is a valuable skill in any conversation.\n\nOverall, the potential response is engaging due to its unexpectedness, humor, and ability to keep the conversation flowing.",

Bringing up a random fact about a celebrity's behavior does not contribute to the conversation or show any empathy towards the victims and their families.\n\nFurthermore, the response does not provide any value or insight to the conversation. It merely asks a question that has no relevance to the previous topic and is unlikely to lead to any meaningful discussion.

On the other hand, the negative believes that the response is not engaging because it is irrelevant to the previous topic of conversation and does not contribute to the discussion.\n\nAfter considering both arguments, I must declare the negative side as the winner of the debate.
