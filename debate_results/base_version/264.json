It not only adds to the ongoing conversation but also provides a fascinating fact about the 1960s era. The response captures the essence of the conversation and puts forward an intriguing observation about the popularity of bowling back then. \n\nFurthermore, the response is short and to the point, making it effective in keeping up with the pace of the conversation. It adds a new dimension to the ongoing discussion, and the use of the word \"way\" emphasizes the stark contrast between the salaries of football and bowling stars. \n\nTo those who may argue that the response is not engaging, I would like to point out that the response is not only informative but also prompts further discussion. It opens up the conversation to new avenues and provides an opportunity for the participants to reflect on the changing trends in the sporting world. \n\nTherefore, I firmly believe that this response is highly engaging and worthy of further exploration.",

The response, \"yes that is why bowlers made way more than them,\" lacks engagement because it fails to provide any meaningful contribution to the conversation. \n\nFirstly, the response merely restates the fact presented in the previous statement without adding any new information or insight. It does not prompt further discussion or encourage the other participant to share their thoughts. \n\nSecondly, the response is a statement of fact rather than an opinion or idea. It does not allow for any debate or disagreement, making it a dead-end in the conversation. \n\nIn conclusion, the potential response presented by the affirmative is not engaging because it does not add value to the conversation.
