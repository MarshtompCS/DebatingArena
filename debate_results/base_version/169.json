The statement is not directly related to the previous topic of conversation about football and can seem like a random deviation from the topic.\n\nAdditionally, the response lacks depth and substance. It does not provide any new information or insights that can further the conversation or make it more engaging. The statement is merely a surface-level observation that does not contribute much to the conversation.\n\nMoreover, the response can be interpreted as dismissive of the previous fact mentioned about the pay gap between top bowlers and football players in the 60s. It can come across as changing the topic to avoid discussing the potential significance of this fact.\n\nIn conclusion, while the response may show some interest in the conversation, it lacks substance and depth, and does not directly relate to the previous topic.
