Let me explain why.\n\nFirstly, this response is engaging because it immediately captures the attention of the listener. It creates a sense of curiosity and prompts the listener to ask for clarification. This is exactly what we want in a conversation - to keep the listener interested and engaged.\n\nSecondly, this response is effective in bridging the gap between the two speakers. It acknowledges the previous speaker's opinion without necessarily agreeing to it. This can lead to a more productive and respectful conversation, which is always a desirable outcome.\n\nLastly, this response is versatile and can be used in a variety of situations. It is non-committal and allows the speaker to easily pivot to a different topic if necessary.\n\nIn conclusion, the response \"I don't watch it but I don't really watch it\" is an engaging and effective potential response in this conversation. It prompts further discussion, acknowledges the previous speaker's opinion, and is versatile enough to be used in different situations.",

Allow me to provide a few reasons why.\n\nFirstly, while it may capture the attention of the listener, it does so in a negative way. It creates confusion and is not a clear response to the previous speaker's question. This can lead to a breakdown in communication and a lack of engagement in the conversation.\n\nSecondly, this response does not bridge the gap between the two speakers as effectively as my opponent suggests. It fails to acknowledge the previous speaker's opinion in a meaningful way and does not contribute to a more productive conversation.\n\nLastly, while this response may be versatile, it lacks substance and does not add anything of value to the conversation. It is a non-committal response that does not contribute to the discussion in any meaningful way.\n\nIn conclusion, the response \"I don't watch it but I don't really watch it\" is not an engaging or effective potential response in this conversation. It creates confusion, fails to bridge the gap between the speakers, and lacks substance.",

Instead, it acknowledges the previous speaker's question and offers a clear response that can prompt further discussion. Secondly, this response may not acknowledge the previous speaker's opinion in a direct way, but it still shows a level of engagement by providing a response that can lead to a more productive conversation. Lastly, while it may be non-committal, this response can still add value to the conversation by allowing the speaker to share their opinion without shutting down the discussion.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the response \"I don't watch it but I don't really watch it\" is an engaging and effective potential response in this conversation. It can prompt further discussion, show a level of engagement, and allow for the speaker to share their opinion without shutting down the conversation.",

It is a vague and confusing response that can lead to a breakdown in communication.\n\nSecondly, this response does not show a level of engagement. In fact, it is quite the opposite.

The affirmative side argues that this response is engaging because it prompts further discussion, acknowledges the previous speaker's opinion, and is versatile enough to be used in different situations. On the other hand, the negative side argues that this response is not engaging because it creates confusion, lacks substance, and does not contribute to the conversation in any meaningful way.\n\nAfter considering the arguments presented by both sides, I have to declare the negative side as the winner of this debate. While the affirmative side has presented some valid points, the negative side has effectively rebutted them by highlighting the shortcomings of the response. The negative side's argument that the response lacks engagement and value is more convincing, and therefore, they win the debate.",
