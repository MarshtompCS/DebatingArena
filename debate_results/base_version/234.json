It presents an interesting fact that not many people may be aware of, and then goes on to offer an explanation as to why the British were beaten by the Native Americans in swimming. This creates a sense of curiosity and intrigue in the listener, as they want to know more about the history of swimming and how different cultures have impacted the sport. The response also adds to the conversation by providing a new point of view and encouraging further discussion. Overall, the engagingness level of this response is high due to its ability to generate interest and stimulate conversation.",

Additionally, the response does not encourage further discussion as it fails to provide any new insights or perspectives. The listener is left with a superficial understanding of the fact and no reason to continue the conversation.

While the fact presented may be interesting, the lack of depth and new insights makes it difficult to sustain engagement. The listener may initially be interested, but without any new perspectives or insights, they are unlikely to continue the conversation.
