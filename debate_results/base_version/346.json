        "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, the response given by our speaker is undeniably engaging. It provokes curiosity and sparks interest in the audience, leaving them wanting to know more about the topic. The speaker's question about the 2002 Creed concert not only shows their interest in the topic but also encourages the audience to reflect on how a concert could go so wrong that people would file a lawsuit. This response is an excellent way to wrap up the conversation as it provides a thought-provoking question that leaves a lasting impression on the audience. \n\nThe con side may argue that the response is not relevant to the conversation's current topic, but I disagree. The conversation was about concerts and live music, and the response is related to the topic as it discusses a specific concert. Furthermore, the response does not disrupt the flow of the conversation; it merely builds on the previous discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, the response given by our speaker is engaging and thought-provoking. It leaves a lasting impression on the audience and enhances the conversation's overall quality.",

        "content": ": While I appreciate the affirmative's opinion, I must respectfully disagree. While the response may be somewhat interesting, it does not add any substantial value to the conversation. The fact about the 2002 Creed concert is unrelated to the previous discussion about live concerts and ancient amphitheaters. \n\nAdditionally, the response's question is not thought-provoking in any significant way. It is merely a passing thought that does not lead to any meaningful discussion or exchange of ideas. The response's question is rather superficial and does not contribute to the conversation's overall quality. \n\nFinally, the response's conclusion, \"It's been great chatting with you. Have a good day!\" is not an engaging way to end the conversation. It is a generic and unremarkable way to wrap up a conversation, leaving the audience with an unfulfilled feeling. \n\nIn conclusion, while the response may be somewhat interesting, it does not add any real value to the conversation. The question posed is not thought-provoking and does not lead to any meaningful exchange of ideas. Furthermore, the response's conclusion is lackluster and unengaging.",

        "content": "Both sides presented their opinions on the engaging level of the response in the conversation. The affirmative side argued that the response was engaging and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impression on the audience. They also claimed that the response was relevant to the conversation's topic and did not disrupt the flow of the conversation. \n\nIn contrast, the negative side argued that the response did not add any substantial value to the conversation. They claimed that the question posed was not thought-provoking and did not lead to any meaningful exchange of ideas. Additionally, the negative side criticized the response's conclusion, stating that it was unengaging and lacked substance.\n\nIn my opinion, the affirmative side wins the debate. The response was engaging and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impression on the audience. Moreover, the question posed was relevant to the conversation's topic and built on the previous discussion. The negative side failed to provide substantial evidence to support their claims that the response lacked engagingness. Therefore, the affirmative side's argument was more convincing and persuasive.",

( jazz or otherwise ? ) \n that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though . \n it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music ! \n i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii \n wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ... \n it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters \n well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ? \n now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit \n\n",
