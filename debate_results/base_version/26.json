        "content": ": I respectfully disagree with the affirmative's opinion on the engaging level of the potential response. While it may be true that the response brings up a fascinating fact, it does not necessarily lead to a meaningful conversation. \n\nFirstly, the response does not provide any personal insight or opinion on the matter. It simply states that the score is crazy, which is a sentiment that most people would agree with. This does not allow for much depth in the conversation and may lead to the topic being quickly abandoned. \n\nSecondly, the response does not actively engage the other person in the conversation. It merely presents a fact and leaves it up to the other person to respond. This puts the burden of keeping the conversation engaging solely on the other person, which may lead to them losing interest or feeling like they are carrying the conversation.\n\nLastly, the fact presented in the response is not particularly relevant to the current conversation. The conversation up until this point has been focused on personal experiences with football and favorite teams. Bringing up a historical fact that is not related to the current discussion may cause confusion or disrupt the flow of the conversation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the potential response may be interesting, it does not necessarily lead to an engaging conversation. Its lack of personal insight, failure to actively engage the other person, and lack of relevance to the current conversation make it a subpar example of an engaging response.",

Your points are valid and provide a different viewpoint on the matter. \n\n[Affirmative]: While I understand the Negative's perspective, I must respectfully disagree. I believe that the potential response is engaging precisely because it presents a fact that is not commonly known, which can lead to a deeper discussion on the topic. \n\nAdditionally, the fact presented in the response may not be directly related to the current conversation, but it can still be used as a launching point for further discussion. It allows for the conversation to shift towards a new direction, which can be refreshing and engaging for both parties. \n\nFurthermore, while the potential response may not provide personal insight or opinion, it does invite the other person to share their thoughts and opinions on the matter. This can lead to a more collaborative and engaging conversation, as both parties have the opportunity to share their perspectives.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential response is engaging because it presents a unique fact that can lead to a deeper discussion, allows for the conversation to shift towards a new direction, and invites the other person to share their thoughts and opinions.",

While the potential response may present a unique fact, it does not actively engage the other person and may disrupt the flow of the conversation. The Negative's arguments were more convincing in highlighting the potential shortcomings of the potential response and why it may not be an engaging response.",
