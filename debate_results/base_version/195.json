It is an unexpected response that takes the conversation in a new direction. It is a response that challenges common stereotypes and misconceptions about football. It is a response that is likely to spark curiosity and interest in the listener. \n\nI anticipate that the con side may argue that the response is not relevant to the conversation at hand.

It may even inspire the listener to research more about the topic and become more informed. \n\nIn conclusion, the response \"yeah I guess so. Did you know women can play too?\" is a highly engaging response that adds value to the conversation. It is relevant, thought-provoking, and inclusive. Thank you.",

The fact that women can play in the NFL is already established, and the response merely reiterates this fact without providing any further insight or analysis. \n\nSecondly, the response does not contribute to the flow of the conversation. It interrupts the natural progression of the dialogue and may even be perceived as a non-sequitur. \n\nLastly, the response may even come across as patronizing or condescending to the person who initiated the conversation. It implies that the speaker is not aware of basic facts about football, which can be discouraging and off-putting. \n\nIn conclusion, the response \"yeah I guess so.
