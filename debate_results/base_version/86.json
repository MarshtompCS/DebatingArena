The participant starts with a repeated phrase \"i have not,\" which creates a sense of curiosity in the listener's mind. The repetition forces the listener to pay attention to what comes next. Moreover, the use of \"what is it about?\" at the end of the response indicates the participant's interest in the topic, which makes the listener feel valued and heard. This response not only shows interest in the conversation but also invites the speaker to continue with the topic. Therefore, I strongly believe that the response is highly engaging and warrants the listener's further attention.",
