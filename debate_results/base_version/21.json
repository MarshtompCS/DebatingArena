My esteemed opponent may argue that the response lacks substance and does not contribute to the conversation, but I would like to point out that the purpose of the response is not to add new information or continue the conversation. Instead, its purpose is to show appreciation for the conversation and to leave a positive impression on the other person.\n\nMoreover, this response is an excellent way to end a conversation as it conveys politeness, warmth, and friendliness. By expressing gratitude for the conversation, it signals to the other person that their time and effort were valued and appreciated. This, in turn, encourages the other person to engage in future conversations, building a rapport and fostering a positive relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the response \"I'm sure he was, it was great chatting with you!\" is a highly engaging response that effectively concludes the conversation. Its purpose is to show appreciation, leave a positive impression, and encourage future conversations. Therefore, I urge the moderator to consider the engagingness of the response and to rule in its favor. Thank you.",

        "content": ": Thank you, moderator, and greetings to my opponent. While I understand the positive sentiment behind the response \"I'm sure he was, it was great chatting with you!\", I must disagree with my opponent's argument that it is a highly engaging response. In fact, I would argue that this response is quite unengaging and may even have a negative impact on the conversation.\n\nTo begin with, this response lacks any substance or contribution to the conversation. It does not engage the other person or encourage further discussion, but rather signals that the conversation has ended and that the other person should move on. This is not the type of response that encourages engagement, but rather one that ends it.\n\nFurthermore, while expressing gratitude for the conversation is nice, it is not necessarily an engaging response. Engaging responses are those that keep the conversation going, that ask questions or provide insights that encourage the other person to share their own thoughts and opinions. This response does not do that, but rather shuts down the conversation and signals that the other person should move on.\n\nIn conclusion, while I understand the positive sentiment behind the response \"I'm sure he was, it was great chatting with you!\", I must disagree with my opponent's argument that it is a highly engaging response. It lacks substance, does not contribute to the conversation, and may even have a negative impact on engagement. Therefore, I urge the moderator to consider these points and rule against the engagingness of the response. Thank you.",

On the other hand, the negative argued that the response lacks substance, does not contribute to the conversation, and may even have a negative impact on engagement.\n\nBased on the arguments presented, the negative has a stronger case. While expressing gratitude is important, it does not necessarily make a response engaging. Engaging responses are those that keep the conversation going, that ask questions or provide insights that encourage the other person to share their own thoughts and opinions. The affirmative failed to provide any evidence that the response in question accomplishes this goal. Therefore, the negative wins the debate.",
