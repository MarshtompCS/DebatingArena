It captures the attention of the listener and makes them want to know more. The fact that this response concerns is shocking and intriguing. The statement about the movie Trojan Wars with a budget of $15 million that earned only $309 in box office is mind-boggling. It immediately draws the listener into the conversation and creates a sense of curiosity.\n\nFurthermore, this potential response is incredibly relevant to the conversation. As we have been discussing the importance of box office revenue and the film industry, this fact adds weight to the discussion. It highlights the risks associated with the industry and the importance of making the right decisions when it comes to film production and promotion.\n\nIn summary, the potential response is an excellent addition to the conversation, providing a shocking fact that engages the listener and is highly relevant to the topic at hand. I urge the moderator to allow this response to be included in the conversation. Thank you.",

The statement lacks any substance or depth, providing no new information or insight into the conversation. It merely states the fact without any context or analysis, making it a weak addition to the conversation.\n\nFurthermore, the potential response does not contribute to the flow of the conversation. It is a random fact thrown in without any connection to the previous statements made. The conversation has been focused on the importance of box office revenue and the film industry, and this fact does not add to that discussion in any way.\n\nIn conclusion, while the fact presented in the potential response is interesting, it does not meet the criteria of an engaging response. It lacks substance, context, and relevance to the conversation at hand. Therefore, I urge the moderator to consider the negative aspects of this potential response and not include it in the conversation.",

The affirmative argued that the fact presented was a shocking and intriguing addition to the conversation, contributing to the flow of the discussion and adding a new dimension to the topic. The negative, on the other hand, argued that the fact provided no new insights or perspectives, lacked relevance, and interrupted the flow of the conversation.\n\nAfter considering both sides, I have concluded that the negative wins the debate. While the fact presented in the potential response was interesting, it lacked substance and relevance and did not contribute to the flow of the conversation. The negative successfully argued that shock value alone is not enough to make a response engaging, and the fact presented did not meet the criteria of an engaging response. Therefore, the negative stance on this issue is more convincing, and the potential response should not be included in the conversation.",
