It shows the speaker's concern for the safety of the players, which is a crucial issue in the NFL. The response not only acknowledges the fact that the NFL is using tracking chips on players, but it also adds to the conversation by suggesting a potential use of this technology.\n\nMoreover, the response is brief and to the point, making it easy for the listener to understand and respond to. It does not stray away from the topic at hand, which is important in keeping the conversation focused and engaging. \n\nIn contrast, the negative side may argue that the response lacks depth and fails to explore the potential uses of the tracking chips. However, I believe that the response is meant to be a starting point for further discussion, and it leaves room for the conversation to progress. Furthermore, the response is not intended to provide an exhaustive list of potential uses for the tracking chips, but rather to express the speaker's hope that the technology can be used for the betterment of the NFL.\n\nIn conclusion, the response \"yeah i hope they can use that to make the game safer\" is a highly engaging and relevant contribution to the conversation. It shows the speaker's concern for player safety and opens up the conversation to further exploration of the potential uses of tracking chips in the NFL.",

The response lacks depth and does not provide any specific suggestions for how the tracking chips can be used to make the game safer.
