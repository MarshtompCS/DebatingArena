        "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, the response \"wow that is very impressive, i think he was the best qb ever ever\" is undeniably engaging. It shows enthusiasm and admiration towards the discussed topic, and it effectively captures the attention of the listener. \n\nFirstly, let me address any potential objections from the negative side. They may argue that the response lacks depth and substance, but I would argue that the engagingness of a response is not solely determined by its level of detail. Instead, it is the emotional impact that the response has on the listener that makes it engaging. The response in question effectively conveys the speaker's awe and admiration towards the discussed topic, and this emotional response is what makes it engaging.\n\nFurthermore, the response is also effective in promoting further discussion. By expressing such a strong opinion, the speaker is opening up the conversation to potential counterarguments and alternative viewpoints. The response is a clear invitation for the other person to engage in a deeper discussion about the topic at hand.\n\nIn conclusion, the response \"wow that is very impressive, i think he was the best qb ever ever\" is an engaging response in a conversation. It effectively captures the listener's attention and promotes further discussion.",

The response \"wow that is very impressive, I think he was the best qb ever ever\" may be engaging on an emotional level, but it lacks any substance or depth. \n\nEngagingness is not just about capturing the listener's attention, it is also about providing meaningful contributions to the conversation. This response fails to do so as it does not provide any supporting evidence or reasoning for the speaker's claim. It is merely an unsupported opinion, and as such, it does not add any value to the conversation.\n\nFurthermore, the response is also one-sided and does not leave any room for constructive discussion. By stating that the player is the best ever, the speaker shuts down any potential counterarguments or alternative viewpoints. This type of conversation does not promote a healthy exchange of ideas and does not lead to any meaningful conclusions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the response may be emotionally engaging, it lacks substance and depth, and it fails to promote constructive discussion.
