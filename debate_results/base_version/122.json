Firstly, it is a natural and relatable response to the fact presented. It shows curiosity and interest in the movie, which may prompt further conversation and discussion. \n\nSecondly, the response does not shut down the conversation but instead serves as an invitation for the other person to share their opinion or experience with the movie. This creates a collaborative and inclusive atmosphere in the conversation, making it more engaging for both parties.\n\nFurthermore, the response is concise and to the point, avoiding any unnecessary elaboration or repetition. This keeps the conversation moving forward and prevents it from becoming stagnant or boring.\n\nIn conclusion, the response \"yeah, I haven't seen it.

It does not contribute to the conversation in any meaningful way, and instead, it is a dead-end response that does not encourage further discussion.\n\nLastly, the response lacks any enthusiasm or energy, which is necessary for engaging conversation. It is a dull and unenthusiastic response that fails to create a lively atmosphere, making it challenging to continue the conversation.\n\nIn conclusion, the response \"yeah, I haven't seen it.
