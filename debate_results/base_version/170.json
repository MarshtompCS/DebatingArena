While I agree that the response provided by the speaker acknowledges the fact presented by the previous speaker and adds an interesting piece of information, I must point out that it lacks depth and substance.\n\nThe speaker simply states that the score of the highest scoring football game ever was 222-0 and expresses curiosity about how much it was actually made. While this may pique the other person's interest, it does not provide any significant insights or analysis into the topic at hand.\n\nFurthermore, the use of the word \"crazy\" to describe both the fact presented by the previous speaker and the highest scoring football game ever may come across as overly simplistic and lacking in nuance. It does not demonstrate a deep understanding or appreciation of the topic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the response may be engaging on a surface level, it lacks depth and substance, and does not contribute significantly to the conversation.",
