It is a non sequitur, which is a great technique to keep the conversation interesting and unpredictable. Moreover, it is a surprising fact that not many people may know about, which adds to the intrigue. The response also shows a level of confidence in the speaker, who is willing to bring up a completely unrelated topic to keep the conversation going. This shows that the speaker is comfortable in social situations and is willing to take risks to keep the conversation flowing. Therefore, the response is highly engaging and helps to keep the conversation interesting and stimulating.",

The fact provided has no connection to the ongoing conversation, and it does not contribute to the discussion in any meaningful way. In fact, it creates a sense of confusion and disrupts the flow of the conversation. The listener may be left wondering what the speaker's point was, and how it relates to the conversation at hand. This can lead to disinterest and disengagement from the conversation. Additionally, the response does not show any consideration for the listener's interests or opinions, which can make them feel disrespected and unimportant. Therefore, I believe that the response is not engaging and does not contribute positively to the conversation.",

After considering both arguments, I must conclude that the negative has presented a stronger argument. The response provided is not engaging, but rather disruptive and confusing. It does not contribute to the conversation in any meaningful way, and may even lead to disinterest and disengagement from the listener. Therefore, the negative wins the debate.",
