However, I would like to point out that it is precisely the unexpected nature of this response that makes it engaging. It takes the conversation in a completely different direction, and keeps the other person on their toes. \n\nFurthermore, the response also includes two interesting pieces of information - a Lady Gaga white blood drive and a jazz concert hosted by the president of Spotify. These pieces of information are not only engaging, but they also have the potential to spark further conversation and discovery. \n\nIn conclusion, the response given may seem random, but that is precisely what makes it engaging. It provides unexpected information and takes the conversation in a new direction, while also providing interesting tidbits that could lead to further discussion. Thank you.",

While it is true that unexpected responses can sometimes be engaging, this particular response is not engaging in a positive way. It completely derails the conversation and takes it in a direction that has nothing to do with the previous topic. \n\nMoreover, the two pieces of information included in the response are completely unrelated to each other and to the current conversation. The Lady Gaga white blood drive and the jazz concert hosted by the president of Spotify have nothing to do with animated movies, DC, or crab soup. \n\nTherefore, this response not only fails to be engaging in a positive way, but it also disrupts the flow of the conversation and makes it difficult to continue. It does not contribute anything meaningful or relevant to the discussion. \n\nIn conclusion, this response is not engaging, but rather a distraction from the current topic. It fails to provide any value to the conversation and makes it difficult to continue in a meaningful way. Thank you.",

On the other hand, the negative side argues that the response completely derails the conversation and fails to contribute anything relevant or meaningful. \n\nBased on the arguments presented, the winner of the debate is the negative side. While unexpected responses can sometimes be engaging, the given response fails to contribute anything relevant to the conversation and disrupts the flow of the discussion. The negative side effectively argues that the response is a distraction and does not provide any value to the conversation. Therefore, the negative side wins the debate.",
