Firstly, the response aligns with the current topic of discussion, which is about interesting species worth studying. The fact that 84% of genes associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish is fascinating and relevant to the ongoing conversation.\n\nSecondly, the response presents a new and intriguing piece of information that is not common knowledge. It sparks curiosity and encourages further discussion, which is a key aspect of an engaging response. It also shows that the speaker is well-informed and knowledgeable on the topic, which adds credibility to their opinions.\n\nLastly, the response is concise and to the point, which is crucial in keeping the conversation flowing and maintaining the audience's attention. It does not deviate from the topic or introduce unnecessary information, which can be a turn-off for listeners.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential response presented is highly engaging due to its relevance, novelty, and conciseness. It adds value to the ongoing conversation and encourages further discussion. As the affirmative, I strongly support this response and believe that it will keep the conversation lively and interesting.",

The topic of interesting species worth studying was brought up, and the fact that 84% of genes associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish is a very interesting and relevant point. It adds to the discussion and prompts further thought and inquiry, which is what an engaging response should do.\n\nSecondly, while the response may lack personal input, it is still a valuable contribution to the conversation. It is a fact that many people may not be aware of, and it is presented in a clear and concise manner. It provides a foundation for further discussion, and it shows that the speaker is knowledgeable on the topic.\n\nLastly, the fact presented is unique and memorable precisely because it is not common knowledge. It is a surprising and thought-provoking fact that may stick in the audience's mind and prompt them to further research and inquiry.\n\nIn conclusion, I maintain that the potential response presented is highly engaging due to its relevance, novelty, and clarity.
