        "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, the response given by our affirmative team member is a prime example of an engaging response in a conversation. It not only acknowledges the fact presented by the previous speaker but also adds a touch of humor to make the conversation more interesting. The response also showcases the speaker's knowledge and wit, which are key ingredients in keeping a conversation engaging.\n\nNow, our negative team member may argue that the response lacks coherence and relevance. However, we must remember that we are judging the engaging level of the response and not its coherence or relevance. The fact presented by the previous speaker is about the director of the movie and not about the character Edna Mode. Hence, the response given by our affirmative team member is perfectly relevant.\n\nFurthermore, the response is concise and does not repeat any information. It adds a new dimension to the conversation, making it more engaging and interesting. This is precisely what an engaging response should do - move the conversation forward, add value to it, and make it more enjoyable.\n\nIn conclusion, the response given by our affirmative team member is an excellent example of an engaging response. It is witty, relevant, and adds value to the conversation. We must keep in mind that an engaging response is not just about coherence and relevance but also about making the conversation interesting and enjoyable.",

        "content": ": Thank you, moderator. While I appreciate my opponent's view, I must disagree. The response given by our affirmative team member is far from engaging. In fact, it lacks coherence and relevance, which are essential components of an engaging response.\n\nFirstly, the response begins with a statement that contradicts itself. The speaker says they knew that the director of the movie was Edna Mode, but then states that the director did not find it interesting. This contradiction makes the response confusing and difficult to follow, which detracts from its engagingness.\n\nSecondly, the response fails to address the question asked by the previous speaker. The fact presented by the previous speaker is about the writer of the movie, and the question asked is about the writer. However, the response does not provide any information about the writer, making it irrelevant to the conversation.\n\nFinally, the response does not add any value to the conversation. It does not provide any new insights or perspectives but merely repeats information that has already been stated. This lack of originality and creativity makes the response unengaging and boring.\n\nIn conclusion, the response given by our affirmative team member is not engaging. It lacks coherence, relevance, and creativity, which are essential components of an engaging response.",

While my opponent has brought up some points, I would like to clarify a few things.\n\nFirstly, the response given by our affirmative team member is not contradictory but instead adds a touch of humor to the conversation. It acknowledges the fact presented by the previous speaker and provides a witty response, which is precisely what makes a conversation engaging. \n\nSecondly, while the response does not directly answer the question asked by the previous speaker, it still adds value to the conversation by providing additional information about the director of the movie. As I mentioned earlier, an engaging response should move the conversation forward and add value to it, which is precisely what this response does.\n\nFinally, my opponent claims that the response does not add any new insights or perspectives, but I would argue that it does. The response showcases the speaker's knowledge and humor, which are unique and valuable perspectives that make the conversation more interesting.\n\nIn conclusion, the response given by our affirmative team member is engaging because it adds humor, value, and unique perspectives to the conversation.
