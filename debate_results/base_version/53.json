        "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, the potential response offered by the affirmative participant is an excellent example of an engaging response. The response is not only informative, but it also provides a new fact that the other participant may not have known before. This response is engaging because it sparks curiosity and encourages the other person to ask more questions about the hamburger button. \n\nFurthermore, the affirmative participant has demonstrated their willingness to learn and share their newfound knowledge. This attitude of openness and curiosity is a hallmark of an engaging conversation partner. \n\nIn contrast, the negative participant may argue that the response is irrelevant to the conversation or that it interrupts the flow of the conversation. However, we must remember that engagingness is not solely based on coherence or relevance. It is about capturing the other person's attention and making the conversation interesting. \n\nIn conclusion, the affirmative team believes that the potential response is engaging because it is informative, sparks curiosity, and demonstrates a willingness to learn and share knowledge. We urge the moderator to consider these factors when evaluating the engaging level of the response.",

        "content": ": Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. While my opponent has made some valid points, I must respectfully disagree with their assessment of the potential response. \n\nFirstly, while the response may provide a new fact about the hamburger button, it does not necessarily contribute to the overall conversation. The fact may be interesting, but it does not address the initial question or add anything substantial to the conversation. \n\nAdditionally, my opponent argues that the response demonstrates a willingness to learn and share knowledge. However, simply regurgitating a fact that was recently learned does not necessarily demonstrate a deep understanding or investment in the topic. It may come across as superficial or insincere. \n\nFinally, I would like to address my opponent's claim that engagingness is not solely based on coherence or relevance. While it is true that engagingness can encompass many factors, coherence and relevance are essential components of any engaging conversation. Without coherence and relevance, the conversation can become confusing or frustrating for both parties involved. \n\nIn conclusion, while the fact presented in the potential response may be interesting, it does not contribute to the overall conversation in a meaningful way. The response also does not necessarily demonstrate a deep understanding or investment in the topic. Finally, coherence and relevance are essential components of engagingness, and without them, the conversation can become confusing or frustrating.",
