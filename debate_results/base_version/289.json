It not only acknowledges the fact about Taylor Swift, but it also adds an interesting observation about her influence and her great voice. The response is unique and unexpected, making it more likely to capture the attention of the listener. \n\nFurthermore, the response adds to the existing conversation by introducing a new topic, which can lead to a more diverse and engaging conversation. It shows the speaker's ability to think creatively and bring new ideas to the table. \n\nIn contrast, the negative side may argue that the response is not relevant to the current conversation, but I would like to remind them that the conversation has already veered off to discussing surprising facts about presidents and their wealth. Therefore, the potential response fits perfectly in the flow of the conversation.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential response is highly engaging, unique, and adds to the conversation. I urge the moderator to allow the conversation to continue and hear more from the speaker who came up with this response.",

The conversation started with a serious topic, school shootings, and has since veered off into discussing surprising facts about presidents and their wealth. Bringing up Taylor Swift and her influence seems out of place and does not contribute to the ongoing conversation.\n\nFurthermore, the response seems like a non-sequitur and may confuse the listener. They may wonder how Taylor Swift's influence and great voice are related to the previous topics discussed. This confusion may lead to disengagement and a lack of interest in continuing the conversation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the potential response may be creative, it is not relevant to the current conversation and may lead to confusion and disengagement. Therefore, I believe it is best to move on to a different topic that is more closely related to the previous discussion.",
