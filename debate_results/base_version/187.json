Firstly, it is unexpected and breaks the flow of the conversation, which can capture the attention of the listener. Secondly, it invites further discussion and prompts the other person to ask for clarification or elaboration, which can lead to a more interesting and dynamic conversation. Finally, it shows a willingness to engage in conversation and share personal opinions, which can be very appealing to those seeking to connect with others. In conclusion, this response is highly engaging and has the potential to lead to a more meaningful conversation.",

The negative, on the other hand, argues that it is not engaging as it fails to address the fact presented, lacks depth, and doesn't provide any unique opinions.\n\nBased on the arguments presented, the negative side wins the debate as they were able to effectively rebut the affirmative's claims and provide logical reasons why the response is not engaging.",
