The response not only highlights the fact that the Native Americans introduced the front crawl swimming stroke to the west, but it also explains the context in which it happened. The affirmative response is not just a statement of fact, but it also adds an interesting layer of history to the conversation.\n\nFurthermore, the response is highly engaging because it invites further discussion. The fact that the Native Americans beat the British in a race because they used the front crawl swimming stroke is an interesting piece of information that can spark a debate or a conversation. This response is not just informative, but it also creates an opportunity for the conversation to continue.\n\nIn conclusion, the affirmative response is highly engaging because it provides an interesting and relevant fact about the history of swimming, and it also invites further discussion. The response is not just a statement of fact, but it adds an interesting layer of history to the conversation, making it a valuable contribution.",

The response may be informative, but it does not necessarily make it engaging.\n\nFirstly, the response lacks any personal opinion or perspective.

This makes it less engaging because it does not allow for any emotional or personal connection with the speaker.\n\nSecondly, the response does not contribute to the flow of the conversation.
