While he may be a well-respected figure in the entertainment industry, his opinion is subjective and may not resonate with everyone. Therefore, mentioning his opinion may not necessarily make the response engaging for everyone in the audience.\n\nSecondly, the response does not add much value to the conversation. It merely reiterates what the previous speaker said about Kung Fu Hustle and adds a statement about Bill Murray's opinion. This does not contribute to the debate in any significant way and may even come across as repetitive to some listeners.\n\nLastly, while the response is concise and natural, it lacks depth and complexity. It does not delve into the intricacies of the movie or explore any interesting themes or ideas that may have made the response more engaging.\n\nIn conclusion, while the response provided by the affirmative participant is not entirely unengaging, it has certain drawbacks that cannot be ignored. It heavily relies on a subjective opinion, does not add much value to the conversation, and lacks depth and complexity.

Firstly, mentioning the opinion of Bill Murray is not just a subjective viewpoint; it is a well-known fact that he has praised Kung Fu Hustle in the past, which adds credibility to the response. Moreover, the negative participant assumes that everyone in the audience may not resonate with Bill Murray's opinion. However, it is reasonable to assume that a significant portion of the audience may be interested in hearing the opinion of a respected figure in the entertainment industry.\n\nSecondly, the response does add value to the conversation by expressing the speaker's agreement with the previous speaker and providing a unique perspective on the movie. This shows that the speaker is invested in the conversation and is actively contributing to the debate.
