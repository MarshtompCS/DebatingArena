It not only acknowledges the fact presented but also adds a humorous element to the conversation. It is relatable to everyone as it highlights how small we are in the grand scheme of things. This response is a great way to keep the conversation going and keep everyone interested. The use of humor is an effective way to engage the audience, and this response does an excellent job of that. Therefore, I strongly believe that this response is highly engaging and deserves recognition.",

The affirmative side argues that the humor used in the response makes it engaging and relatable to the audience. They also claim that the response shows active participation in the conversation. On the other hand, the negative side argues that the response lacks substance and does not add any new information to the conversation.\n\nAfter considering both sides, I have concluded that the negative side wins the debate. While the humor used in the response may be engaging, it does not contribute anything new to the conversation. In a debate, the focus should be on presenting new information and ideas, not just entertaining the audience. Therefore, the negative side's argument that the response lacks substance holds more weight in determining the engaging level of the potential response.",
