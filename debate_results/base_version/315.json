It provides a key fact about the movie's production that many people may not know. This fact is interesting and adds value to the conversation. It also shows that the speaker has a good understanding of the movie and its production.\n\nIn conclusion, the affirmative response is highly engaging and informative. It immediately answers the question asked and provides a valuable fact about the movie's production. Its brevity and personal touch invite further conversation and engagement. Thank you.",
