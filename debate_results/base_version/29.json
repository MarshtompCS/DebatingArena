        "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, the response \"yes, that was Georgia Tech vs Cumberland. What a dominant victory\" is an incredibly engaging response. Firstly, it shows that the speaker has a vast knowledge of football history and can recall specific details about an event that occurred over a century ago. This level of knowledge is impressive and can captivate the attention of the listener.\n\nSecondly, the response is concise and to the point. It doesn't ramble on or go off on a tangent, which can quickly bore or confuse the listener. Instead, it delivers the necessary information in a clear and straightforward manner.\n\nLastly, the response is relatable. It adds to the ongoing conversation about the difficulty of supporting certain football teams and emphasizes how much worse it could be, using the example of a team that lost 220-0. It connects with the listener on a personal level and can elicit a response or further discussion.\n\nIn conclusion, this response stands out as engaging because it demonstrates knowledge, brevity, and relatability. It adds to the conversation and can stimulate further discussion. Therefore, I urge the moderator to consider the engagingness of this response when making their decision.",

        "content": ": I respectfully disagree with my opponent's argument. While the response may show knowledge of football history, it is not necessarily engaging. The fact that the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland 222-0 is not a topic that is relevant or interesting to the ongoing conversation. It is merely a piece of trivia that does not contribute to the conversation in any meaningful way.\n\nMoreover, the response is not particularly concise. It contains unnecessary elaboration, such as \"What a dominant victory.\" This phrase adds nothing to the conversation and only serves to make the response longer.\n\nFinally, the response is not relatable. While it does connect to the ongoing conversation about the difficulty of supporting certain football teams, it does so in a way that is not relevant to the current discussion. The fact that a team lost by a significant margin does not add to the conversation about the challenges of supporting certain teams.\n\nIn conclusion, I would argue that the response is not engaging. It does not add to the conversation in any meaningful way, and it contains unnecessary elaboration that detracts from its brevity. Therefore, I urge the moderator not to consider the engagingness of this response when making their decision.",
