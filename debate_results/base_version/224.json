It captures the attention of the listener by highlighting a unique and interesting fact about Google's new employees. The use of a rhetorical question at the end of the response adds an element of curiosity, leaving the listener wanting to know more. \n\nFurthermore, the response is relevant to the conversation. While the conversation was previously focused on science and movies, the response brings a new and unexpected topic to the table, adding variety and keeping the conversation engaging. \n\nIn addition, the response is concise and to the point. It does not ramble on or veer off topic, but instead provides a quick and interesting fact that adds value to the conversation. \n\nTherefore, I strongly believe that this response is highly engaging and adds value to the conversation.",

While the use of a rhetorical question at the end may add curiosity, it does not necessarily make the response highly engaging.\n\nMoreover, the fact presented about Google's new employees is not relevant to the ongoing conversation about movies and science. It is a random and tangential fact that does not add value to the conversation. In fact, it may even disrupt the flow of the conversation and divert it away from the main topic.\n\nAdditionally, the response lacks any connection to the previous statements made in the conversation. It does not build upon or relate to any of the previous points discussed. This lack of coherence can make the listener feel disconnected and disengaged from the conversation.\n\nTherefore, I argue that the response presented is not highly engaging and does not add value to the conversation. It is random, irrelevant, and lacks coherence.",

The affirmative participant believes that the response is highly engaging due to its relevance, conciseness, and use of a rhetorical question. The negative participant disagrees and argues that the response is not engaging, as it is irrelevant, lacks coherence, and disrupts the flow of the conversation.\n\nBased on the arguments presented, the winner of the debate is the negative participant. They effectively countered the points made by the affirmative participant and presented stronger arguments against the engaging level of the potential response.",
