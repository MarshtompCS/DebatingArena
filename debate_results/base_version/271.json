        "content": ": Ladies and gentlemen, while the affirmative side makes some valid points, we must consider the disadvantages of the response provided. Firstly, the response does not directly relate to the fact given, which was about a former Patriots player who has never fumbled the football in his career. Instead, the response diverts the conversation to a different topic altogether, which may not be of interest to the other person.\n\nFurthermore, the response does not provide any unique or insightful perspectives on the potential benefits of tracking chips in the NFL. It merely restates what is already known about the technology. This lack of originality may not be engaging for the other person, as they may have heard similar opinions before.\n\nFinally, the response does not leave any room for the other person to contribute to the conversation. It is a closed-ended response that does not encourage further discussion, which can be detrimental to the engagement level of the conversation.\n\nTherefore, the negative side believes that the provided response is not highly engaging due to its lack of relevance to the given fact, lack of originality, and closed-ended nature.",
