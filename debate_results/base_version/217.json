It may not be coherent or relevant to the conversation, but that is not the point of this debate. The speaker has demonstrated their willingness to think outside the box and bring in a new and unexpected fact. This not only catches the attention of the audience but also encourages them to think and learn new things. The speaker has also displayed confidence in their response, which can further engage the audience and make them interested in what else they have to say. Therefore, I strongly believe that the response has a high level of engagingness and should be considered by the moderator.",

The response provided by our speaker is not only incoherent and irrelevant but also lacks any credibility. The speaker claims that the violin was made out of stone and invented by the Dalton brothers, which is not only untrue but also unrelated to the conversation. This kind of response may catch the audience's attention, but it does not engage them in any meaningful way. In fact, it can even distract them from the topic at hand and lead to confusion. Engagingness should not come at the cost of accuracy and relevance. Therefore, I urge the moderator to disregard this response and consider a more meaningful contribution to the conversation.",

The affirmative argues that the response has a high level of engagingness as it presents a new and unexpected fact that can catch the audience's attention and encourage them to learn more. The confidence displayed by the speaker also adds to the engagingness level. On the other hand, the negative argues that the response is incoherent, irrelevant, and lacks credibility, which can lead to confusion and distract the audience from the topic. \n\nAfter considering both arguments, I must side with the negative. While engagingness is an important aspect of a response, it should not come at the cost of accuracy and relevance. The response provided by the speaker is not only factually incorrect but also unrelated to the conversation, which can lead to confusion and a lack of engagement. Therefore, I must conclude that the negative wins the debate.",
