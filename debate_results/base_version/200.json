Firstly, it adds a touch of humor to the conversation, which can help to lighten the mood and make the conversation more enjoyable. Secondly, it shows that the speaker is comfortable enough with the topic to make a lighthearted joke about it. This can help to build rapport between the two speakers and create a more engaging conversation overall. \n\nI expect that the negative side may argue that the response is not relevant to the topic at hand, but I would counter that it is not always necessary for a response to be directly related to the topic in order to be engaging. In fact, sometimes a humorous or unexpected response can be even more engaging than a straightforward one. \n\nOverall, I believe that the potential response is engaging because it adds a touch of humor to the conversation and shows that the speaker is comfortable with the topic at hand.",
