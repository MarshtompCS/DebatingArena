It not only adds to the ongoing conversation but also brings up an interesting fact about the Sacramento Public Library's \"Library of Things.\" This response has the potential to spark curiosity and interest in the minds of the listeners, as it provides a new perspective on libraries beyond just books.\n\nFurthermore, the response cleverly connects the library's move towards non-traditional items, such as sewing machines, to the changing preferences of the younger generation. This connection is particularly engaging because it taps into the trend of millennials seeking experiences over possessions. This response, therefore, not only adds to the conversation but also has the power to inspire the audience to take action, which makes it an extremely engaging response.\n\nIn conclusion, the affirmative believes that the response is engaging because it not only adds to the conversation but also provides an interesting fact and connects it to the changing preferences of the younger generation, making it relatable and inspiring.",

The fact that some libraries are moving beyond books and allowing patrons to check out things like sewing machines is interesting, but it does not add any value to the current discussion.\n\nFurthermore, the response makes an assumption that more millennials will start going to libraries because of this move towards non-traditional items. However, there is no evidence to support this claim, and it is therefore unreasonable to make such a prediction. Additionally, the response fails to address the main topic of the conversation, which is banned books week.\n\nIn conclusion, the negative believes that the response presented by the affirmative is not engaging because it fails to provide any valuable contribution to the current discussion and makes an unreasonable assumption without any evidence to support it.",

While the response may not directly address the topic of banned books week, it still adds to the conversation by presenting a new perspective on libraries and their offerings beyond books. This can lead to a wider conversation on the importance of libraries and their role in society.\n\nFurthermore, the response's assumption that more millennials will start going to libraries because of the move towards non-traditional items is not unreasonable. Studies have shown that millennials are looking for experiences over possessions, and providing access to items such as sewing machines and other non-traditional items may attract this generation to libraries. \n\nIn conclusion, the affirmative continues to maintain that the response is engaging, as it adds value to the conversation by presenting a new perspective and has the potential to inspire action.",
