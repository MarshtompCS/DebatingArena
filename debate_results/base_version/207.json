It brings up an interesting point that the con side hasn't considered yet. We all know that professional athletes make millions of dollars today, but what about in the past? It's a great question to ask, and it shows a genuine interest in the topic at hand. It also provides an opportunity for the conversation to delve into the history of professional sports and how it has evolved over time. Therefore, I urge the moderator to allow this response to be the next turn in the conversation. Thank you.",

The topic at hand is football and the conversation has already shifted towards discussing the history of the sport. Bringing up the salaries of players in the 1960s seems like a bit of a tangent and could potentially derail the conversation. Additionally, the question doesn't necessarily lead to a stimulating discussion. There's a possibility that the answer could simply be a number and the conversation would come to a halt. Therefore, I don't think this response is the best choice for the next turn in the conversation. Thank you.",

While it is true that the question could lead to a discussion about the evolution of professional sports and the impact of money on the industry, there are other more engaging ways to approach this topic. For instance, we could discuss the role of endorsements and sponsorships in modern sports, or the ethics of college athletes not being paid for their contributions. These topics are more likely to spark a lively debate and encourage participants to share their personal experiences and opinions.

The negative side, on the other hand, argued that it could potentially derail the conversation and lead to a dead end.\n\nAfter considering both arguments, I have come to the conclusion that the negative side wins the debate. While the potential response may have some engaging qualities, the negative side's argument that it could potentially derail the conversation and lead to a dead end outweighs the affirmative's argument. Additionally, the negative side presented alternative, more engaging topics that could be discussed instead.
