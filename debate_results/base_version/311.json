It not only acknowledges the fact presented in the conversation but also adds a new perspective to it. The response highlights the importance of privacy invasion in the age of social media, a topic that is highly relevant and concerning to many people. \n\nFurthermore, the response also praises the actions taken by Facebook and Twitter to combat the issue, which shows a positive attitude towards the social networks. This positivity can encourage others to take action against similar violations of privacy. \n\nIn contrast, the negative side has not presented any argument against the engaging level of the response. They have only provided information about the fact presented in the conversation, which does not address the topic of the competition. \n\nTherefore, I urge the moderator to consider the engaging level of the response and award points to the affirmative side for providing a compelling and thought-provoking contribution to the conversation. Thank you.",

        "content": ": I disagree with the affirmative side's assessment of the response. While it does acknowledge the issue of privacy invasion and the actions taken by Facebook and Twitter, it does not provide any new information or unique perspective. The response simply restates what has already been discussed in the conversation. \n\nFurthermore, the response does not address the question of engagingness level. It does not invite further discussion or debate, nor does it challenge any assumptions or beliefs. It is a passive response that does not contribute much to the conversation.\n\nTherefore, I argue that the response is not highly engaging and does not meet the criteria of the competition. The negative side has presented a fact that directly relates to the conversation and highlights the severity of the issue. We have also refuted the affirmative side's claim that the response is engaging. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the negative side has presented a stronger argument and that the response is not highly engaging.",
