They do not waste any time in providing the information and do so in a natural and conversational way. It is this type of engagement that keeps the conversation flowing and interesting. \n\nIn conclusion, the response presented is highly engaging because it adds new information to the conversation and is delivered in a concise and natural manner.

        "content": ": Thank you, moderator. While I agree that the response presented does add some interesting information to the conversation, I do not believe it is highly engaging. \n\nFirstly, the response does not actually answer the question asked by the previous speaker. They were asked who wrote the movie, not who voiced one of the characters. This lack of coherence detracts from the engagingness of the response as it shows a lack of attention to the conversation. \n\nAdditionally, while the new information presented may be interesting, it is not particularly relevant to the conversation at hand. The fact that the director voiced one of the characters does not have much bearing on the question of who wrote the movie. \n\nFinally, the response is delivered in a very matter-of-fact way that does not encourage further conversation or exploration of the topic. It is a simple statement of fact that does not invite any further discussion. \n\nFor these reasons, I must disagree with my opponent and say that the response presented is not highly engaging.",
