While it is true that the response shows enthusiasm and agreement towards the movie, it lacks substance and does not contribute to the conversation.

It is a generic response that anyone could give to a movie recommendation. It does not stand out or make the speaker memorable in any way.\n\nIn conclusion, while the response may show enthusiasm and agreement, it lacks substance, does not encourage further discussion, and is not unique or memorable.
