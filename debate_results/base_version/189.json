It acknowledges that the other person has something valuable to contribute and that their knowledge is worth listening to. This can help build trust and rapport in the conversation and create a positive and enjoyable experience for both parties.\n\nIn summary, the response \"I didn't know that!\" is highly engaging because it expresses curiosity, encourages further conversation, shows respect for the other person, and can help build trust and rapport.",

It is a simple acknowledgement that the speaker is not aware of a particular fact, without any follow-up questions or comments to continue the conversation.\n\nIn fact, this response can even be seen as a conversation killer because it does not offer any new information or perspective to the discussion. It puts the burden on the other person to continue the conversation, which can be tiring and unengaging.\n\nMoreover, constantly repeating the same response can make the conversation feel repetitive and boring. It is important to show genuine interest and curiosity in the conversation by asking follow-up questions, sharing personal experiences, or offering new insights.\n\nTherefore, while expressing curiosity is important, the response \"I didn't know that!\" alone is not enough to make a conversation engaging. It is important to actively participate in the conversation and contribute to it in a meaningful way.",
