The speaker's use of rhetorical questioning is also very effective in keeping the conversation going. The response is not only informative but also thought-provoking, as it raises the question of whether sharks ever had rib cages. Furthermore, the speaker's use of humor in the response helps to lighten the mood and make the conversation more enjoyable. Overall, the engaging level of this response is undeniable, and I urge the moderator to allow us to continue the conversation.",

The question raised by the speaker is not relevant or necessary to the discussion at hand. Additionally, the attempt at humor feels forced and does not contribute to the flow of the conversation. The response also lacks a clear connection to the previous topic of discussion, which was about Iceland and traveling between towns by flight. Therefore, I do not believe this response is highly engaging and should not be used to continue the conversation.",

While it is true that the response may not be directly related to the previous topic of discussion, it still adds value to the conversation by introducing a new and interesting fact about sharks. The speaker's use of rhetorical questioning is also effective in keeping the conversation going and promoting further discussion. As for the attempt at humor, it is subjective and depends on personal taste. However, I believe it adds a lighthearted and friendly tone to the conversation. In conclusion, the engaging level of this response should not be discounted, and we should continue the conversation based on the speaker's contribution.",

The affirmative participant believes that the response is highly engaging due to the introduction of a new fact about sharks, the effective use of rhetorical questioning, and the use of humor. On the other hand, the negative participant argues that the response lacks engagement because it is not relevant to the previous topic, the use of rhetorical questioning does not necessarily make it engaging, and the attempt at humor feels forced.\n\nAfter considering both arguments, I have to declare the negative participant as the winner of the debate. While the affirmative participant made some valid points about the engagingness of the response, the negative participant's argument that the response lacks relevance and does not flow with the conversation is more convincing. Therefore, based on the engaging level of the response, the negative participant wins the debate.",
