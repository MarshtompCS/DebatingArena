The response \"that is true. 84% of genes associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish\" may be informative, but it fails to engage the audience on a personal level. \n\nThe fact presented is relevant to the conversation, but it is not relatable to the average person. Unless the audience is specifically interested in medical research, this response may not capture their attention or spark their interest. \n\nFurthermore, the response lacks creativity and originality. It is a straightforward statement of fact without any personal input or unique perspective from the speaker. In a debate about engagingness, it is important to consider not only the relevance of the response but also its ability to captivate and hold the attention of the audience. \n\nIn conclusion, while the response may have some value in terms of adding factual information to the conversation, it falls short in terms of engagingness. It does not offer a personal connection or a unique perspective that could keep the audience interested and invested in the discussion.",
