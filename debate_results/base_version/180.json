Firstly, it is unexpected and catches the listener's attention. The conversation was previously discussing the history of polo shirts, and this response takes a sudden turn towards fashion and appearance. This unexpected shift makes the listener curious and engaged in the conversation.\n\nSecondly, the response is thought-provoking. It makes the listener think about the relationship between clothing and how one is perceived by others. The response encourages the listener to consider how they present themselves to others and whether they feel the need to dress a certain way to gain approval.\n\nLastly, the response is relatable. Everyone can relate to the feeling of wanting to look good in front of others. This response taps into that universal feeling and allows the listener to connect with the conversation on a personal level.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential response \"basically the more clothes you wore the better you looked to others\" is highly engaging due to its unexpected nature, thought-provoking content, and relatability.",

It does not provide any new information or insights on the topic at hand. The statement \"basically the more clothes you wore the better you looked to others\" is a common and subjective opinion that does not add value to the conversation.\n\nLastly, the response is not persuasive.
