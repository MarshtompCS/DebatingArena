        "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, the response provided by my colleague is highly engaging. It grabs the attention of the listener by linking two seemingly unrelated topics - competitive gaming and football. This clever connection makes the listener curious and interested in the response. Additionally, the response contains a surprising fact that is not commonly known. The fact that Brad Johnson is the only quarterback in NFL history to throw a touchdown pass to himself is intriguing and memorable. It is likely to spark further discussion and debate, making it an excellent response. The con side may argue that the response is not relevant to the conversation at hand, but I would like to remind them that engagingness is not solely determined by relevance. The connection between two seemingly unrelated topics is what makes this response so engaging and memorable. Therefore, I urge the moderator to consider the engaging level of the response and award the point to the affirmative side.",

The response may contain a surprising fact, but it fails to connect with the ongoing conversation. The fact that Brad Johnson is the only quarterback in NFL history to throw a touchdown pass to himself is interesting, but it is not relevant to the conversation about fantasy sports and competitive gaming. Therefore, the response does not add value to the conversation and may even derail it. Additionally, the response does not provide any new information or insights that would encourage further discussion. It is merely a factoid that is unlikely to generate any meaningful debate. In conclusion, while the response may be interesting, it lacks relevance and value in the context of the ongoing conversation.",
