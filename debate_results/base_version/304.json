        "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, I strongly believe that the potential response is highly engaging. Firstly, the response shows interest in the topic of books that was brought up in the conversation. This not only shows engagement but also encourages the other person to continue the conversation. Secondly, the response includes a personal touch by stating that the speaker would like to check out some books themselves. This creates a sense of relatability and encourages the other person to share their own book recommendations. Finally, the response ends with a light-hearted tone by adding \"haha\" at the end, which creates a positive vibe and encourages the other person to respond in a similar tone. \n\nI anticipate that the negative side may argue that the response is not relevant to the fact presented in the conversation. However, I argue that the response is not meant to be directly related to the fact, but rather to keep the conversation going in a friendly and engaging manner. Therefore, I urge the moderator to recognize the engagingness of the response and allow the conversation to continue.",
