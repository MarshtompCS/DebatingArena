The response starts with a contradictory statement which immediately grabs the listener's attention. It creates curiosity and prompts the listener to inquire further about the speaker's experience with Facebook. This is an effective way to keep the conversation going and maintain the listener's interest.\n\nFurthermore, the response also adds value to the conversation by providing a fact that is relevant to the topic. The fact about Burger King's promotion is intriguing and may prompt the listener to investigate further. This not only adds value to the conversation but also makes the listener feel informed and engaged.\n\nIn summary, the affirmative participant's response is engaging because of its contradictory statement and its inclusion of a relevant fact. It effectively keeps the conversation going and adds value to the discussion. Therefore, I strongly believe that this response deserves high marks for its engaging level.",

While the contradictory statement may initially grab the listener's attention, it does not contribute to the overall engagement level of the response.\n\nIn fact, the response lacks coherence as the speaker contradicts themselves by saying they do not use Facebook but use it a lot. This contradiction may confuse or frustrate the listener, leading to disengagement.\n\nFurthermore, while the fact about Burger King's promotion may be interesting, it is not directly related to the conversation topic of Facebook usage. This may distract the listener from the main topic and lower their level of engagement.\n\nIn conclusion, the response has several flaws that detract from its engaging level, including lack of coherence and relevance to the conversation topic.
