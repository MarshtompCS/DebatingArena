        "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the potential response is highly engaging. The response not only directly answers the question asked, but it also provides valuable information about the topic being discussed. The fact that Khalil Mack demanded a high salary and was not resigned by the Raiders is an important detail that adds to the conversation. \n\nFurthermore, the response also highlights the financial situation of the Raiders, tying up too much money in Carr and Gruden. This shows that the responder has done their research and is knowledgeable about the subject matter. \n\nI would like to rebut any opinion from the negative side that suggests the response is not engaging. The fact that the responder shares their favorite NFL team, the Giants, is a personal touch that can help build a connection with the other person in the conversation. It is a common tactic used in conversations to build rapport, and therefore, it adds to the engaging level of the response.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential response is engaging as it provides relevant information, shows knowledge about the topic, and includes a personal touch. It is a well-rounded response that adds value to the conversation.",

        "content": ": While I appreciate the effort by the affirmative to defend the potential response, I must disagree. The response is not engaging as it fails to introduce any new information to the conversation. The fact that Khalil Mack demanded a high salary and was not resigned by the Raiders is already known to the person who asked the question. \n\nFurthermore, the responder's statement about the Raiders tying up too much money in Carr and Gruden is a vague and unsubstantiated claim. It is not clear how much money is tied up in these individuals, and it does not add any value to the conversation. The responder could have provided more specific details or examples to support their statement.\n\nLastly, while it is true that mentioning one's favorite NFL team can help build rapport, it does not necessarily make the response engaging. The responder could have instead provided an interesting anecdote or personal experience related to the topic being discussed.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential response is not engaging as it fails to introduce new information, lacks specificity, and misses an opportunity to provide a compelling personal touch.",

        "content": ": Thank you for your arguments. Based on the opinions presented by both sides, I have come to a conclusion. \n\nThe affirmative has argued that the potential response is engaging as it provides relevant information, shows knowledge about the topic, and includes a personal touch. On the other hand, the negative has argued that the potential response fails to introduce new information, lacks specificity, and misses an opportunity to provide a compelling personal touch.\n\nAfter considering both arguments, I have to side with the negative. While the response may answer the question asked, it does not provide any new or specific information that could add value to the conversation. Additionally, the personal touch included in the response is not compelling enough to make it engaging.\n\nTherefore, the negative wins the debate.",

[ the nfl teams that have serious reasons to worry , versus the ones that do n't ] mack , while still with the raiders , had been holding out , seeking such a deal . the raiders did n't want to give it to him . they have a $ 125 million quarterback in carr . they have a $ 100 million coach in gruden . they drew the line at handing out another mammoth deal , not wanting to further strain their budget or push the boundaries of the salary cap . they regarded the king 's ransom of draft picks put forth by the bears , including a pair of first - rounders , as an offer they could n't refuse . in truth , they could have refused it .\n",
