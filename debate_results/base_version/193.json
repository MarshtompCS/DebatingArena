The fact that there is no written rule against female players in the NFL makes this response even more interesting. It opens up a new avenue for debate and discussion, and it is something that people may not have considered before.\n\nSecondly, this response is relevant and timely. With the increasing attention on gender equality and the empowerment of women, it is important to consider whether women can play in traditionally male-dominated sports. This response addresses this issue and encourages further exploration and discussion.\n\nLastly, this response is memorable. It is a bold statement that challenges traditional norms and beliefs. It will stick in the minds of those who hear it and may even inspire action towards promoting gender equality in sports.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential response \"yeah, I wonder if he ever played in the NFL, I think it would be interesting to see a woman play in the NFL\" is engaging, thought-provoking, relevant, timely, and memorable.

It diverts from the topic at hand and delves into a separate issue altogether. The conversation focused on players such as Tom Brady and Kellan Moore, and the potential response shifts the topic towards the inclusion of women in the NFL. This lack of coherence can confuse and disengage the audience.\n\nSecondly, the potential response is not fully relevant to the conversation. While it is true that there is no written rule against female players in the NFL, the conversation did not touch on this topic. The potential response is therefore irrelevant to the current conversation and can detract from the discussion at hand.\n\nLastly, the potential response can be seen as controversial and polarizing. While it may spark heated debate, it can also lead to arguments and division. This can result in a loss of engagement as people may not want to engage in a contentious discussion and may instead shy away from the topic.\n\nIn conclusion, while I appreciate my opponent's position, I must disagree with their view on the potential response. Its lack of coherence, relevance, and potential polarizing effect can detract from the conversation and lead to a loss of engagement.",
