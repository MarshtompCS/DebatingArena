Firstly, it shows a natural curiosity and interest in the topic being discussed, which is always a great way to keep a conversation going. Secondly, it invites further discussion by prompting the other person to share their own thoughts or experiences, which can lead to a deeper and more meaningful conversation. Lastly, it injects a bit of humor into the conversation, which can lighten the mood and make the interaction more enjoyable for everyone involved. In short, this response is engaging because it is curious, open-ended, and humorous, all of which are key ingredients for a successful conversation.",

Firstly, it does not offer any new information or insights that could move the conversation forward. Instead, it simply reiterates what was already said, which can make the conversation feel stagnant or repetitive. Additionally, the attempt at humor might not be well-received by everyone, and could potentially come across as insensitive given the context of the conversation. Lastly, while it does invite further discussion, it does so in a somewhat generic and uncreative way, which might not be enough to keep the conversation going. Overall, I do not believe this response is as engaging as the affirmative side suggests, and could benefit from more substance and thoughtfulness.",

While it is true that the response does not offer new information or insights, it does not necessarily mean that it falls short in engagingness. Sometimes, in a conversation, it's not about providing new information, but rather showing interest and curiosity in what the other person is saying. This response does precisely that, by expressing genuine curiosity about the bad Creed concert and inviting the other person to share their thoughts on the matter. Additionally, while humor can be subjective, in this case, it is not insensitive or inappropriate, as it's merely a lighthearted comment on how bad the concert must have been. Lastly, while the response may not be overly creative, it is still effective in keeping the conversation going, as it prompts the other person to share their thoughts and experiences about bad concerts they may have attended. Therefore, I believe that this response is still highly engaging and serves as an excellent example of how to keep a conversation flowing naturally.",

( jazz or otherwise ? ) \n that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though . \n it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music ! \n i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii \n wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ... \n it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters \n well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ? \n now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit \n\n",
