Imagine the brains it takes to pull that off.\" is highly engaging. Firstly, it catches the attention of the audience by highlighting a unique fact about Brad Johnson that is not commonly known. Secondly, it creates a sense of wonder and amazement by inviting the listeners to imagine the intelligence required to achieve such a feat. This not only keeps the audience engaged but also encourages them to think critically about the topic at hand. Moreover, the response adds value to the conversation by providing relevant information that is related to the previous topic of discussion which was about quarterbacks. In conclusion, the response is highly engaging as it not only piques the curiosity of the audience but also adds value to the conversation.",

Firstly, the response does not contribute anything new to the conversation. It simply restates a fact that has already been mentioned. Secondly, while the fact is unique, it is not particularly relevant to the topic at hand, which is the engagingness of the response. Therefore, it does not add value to the discussion.

They also pointed out that the fact about Brad Johnson is unique and intriguing, making it all the more engaging. The negative side, on the other hand, argued that the response is not as engaging as the affirmative side makes it out to be. They stated that the response does not contribute anything new to the conversation and does not invite the audience to think deeply in a compelling manner. \n\nAfter considering both sides, I believe that the affirmative side wins the debate. They effectively argued that the response is highly engaging by pointing out the relevance of the fact about Brad Johnson and the sense of wonder it creates in the audience. The negative side's argument, while valid, did not effectively rebut the affirmative side's points and did not provide a strong enough case to win the debate.",
