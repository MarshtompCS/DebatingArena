NLP is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and human language. Its goal is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. NLP has numerous applications such as chatbots, sentiment analysis, text classification, and machine translation. We'll dive deeper into these applications as we progress through the module. I hope that helps and let us know if you have any other questions.",

        "content": "[Prof. Alpha]: That's a great summary, Gamma. Just to add to that, NLP involves techniques such as natural language understanding (NLU), natural language generation (NLG), and natural language processing (NLP). It has become increasingly important in recent years, particularly with the rise of big data and the need for machines to process and analyze large amounts of text data. NLP has applications in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and marketing, to name a few. We'll explore these applications in more detail as we progress through the module.",
