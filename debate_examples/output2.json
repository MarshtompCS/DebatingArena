Tokenization: Breaking up text into individual words or phrases, also known as tokens.\n2. Part-of-speech tagging: Assigning grammatical tags to words in a sentence, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.\n3. Named entity recognition: Identifying and categorizing named entities in text, such as people, organizations, and locations.\n4. Sentiment analysis: Determining the emotional tone of a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral.\n5. Language modeling: Predicting the probability of a word or sequence of words in a language.\n\nThese techniques are often implemented using machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Recurrent Neural Networks. The algorithms are trained on large datasets of text to learn patterns and patterns in language, which they can then apply to new text data to make predictions or classifications.",
